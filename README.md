## ThinkingModels
This is the codebase supplementing my application to Neel's MATS 8.0 stream.

#### General Info
- Use the code in the `src` directory to run your experiments, most of the code with comments necessary and related to interp is stored there. 
- I have also added raw analysis notebooks in the `raw_notebooks` dir.
- Most of the data that was used for experimentation has been added in the `data` directory.  


Thanks!
