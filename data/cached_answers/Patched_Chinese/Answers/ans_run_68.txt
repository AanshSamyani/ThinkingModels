Okay, so I’ve got this math problem: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, sounds interesting! Let me try to figure this out step bystep. 

First, I need to understand what’s meant by "first n odd natural numbers." Natural numbers are positive integers, so odds would be numbers like 1,3,5,... So, the first few odd numbers are 1,3,5,7,9,... Got it. Now, suppose n=3. Then, the sum would be 1+3+5=9, which is 3 squared. That checks out! 

Let’s try n=1. Hmm, the sum is just 1, which is 1 squared. That works too. How about n=2? The sum is 1+3=4, which is 2 squared. Okay, so far, so good. Maybe it works for all n?
