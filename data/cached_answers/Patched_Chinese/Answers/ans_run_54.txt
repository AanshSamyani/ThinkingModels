To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), let's consider the sequence of odd numbers:

\[1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\]

Let's denote the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers as \( S_n \). So,

\[
S_n = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + \dots + (2n-1)
\]

To prove that \( S_n = n^2 \), we'll use mathematical induction.

**Base Case:**

For \( n = 1 \):

\[
S_1 = 1 = 1^2 = 1
\]

The base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**

Assume that the statement holds for some \( k \geq 1 \), i.e.,

\[
S_k = k^2
\]

Now consider \( n
