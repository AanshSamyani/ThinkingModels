Alright, let's tackle this problem: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, okay, so we're dealing with odd numbers. Let me recall... odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. 

So, we want to add up these numbers: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1), maybe? Wait, let me think. If I'm looking at the first n odd numbers, starting from 1, then yes, their sum should be n squared. 

But how do I prove this? Maybe I'll try a few examples. Let's say n=1: sum=1=1^2. Good. n=2:1+3=4=2^2. That works. n=3:
