Okay, so I’ve got this math problem here: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, sounds interesting. Let me try to understand what’s going on here. 

First, let me recall what odd numbers are. Odd numbers are numbers that aren’t divisible by 2. So, like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. Got it. Now, I need to sum up the first n odd numbers. So, if n=1, it’s just 1; if n=2, it’s 1+3=4; n=3, it’s 1+3+5=9; n=4, it’s 1+3+5+7=16. Hmm, wait, these sums are looking familiar. 

Let’s list them out:  
For n=1: Sum =1  
For n=2: Sum=4  
For n
