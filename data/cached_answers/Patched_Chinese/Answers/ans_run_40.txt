To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), let's proceed step by step.

**Step 1: Understanding Odd Numbers**

Odd natural numbers are numbers that cannot be divided evenly by \( 2 \). They consist of numbers like \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\). The \(k\)-th odd number can be expressed as:
\[ a_k = 2k - 1 \]
where \(k = 1, 2, 3, \dots\).

**Step 2: Summing the First \(n\) Odd Numbers**

We want to find the sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) odd numbers:
\[ S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dots + a_n \]
Substituting the expression for \(a_k\):
\[ S = (2 \times 1 -
