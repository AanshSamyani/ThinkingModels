Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me think. Odd numbers are like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, first, maybe I should write down what the sum looks like. 

Let's say n=1. Then the sum is just 1. On the right side, n squared is 1, so that works. Now n=2. The odds are 1+3=4, which equals 2 squared=4. Okay, so far it works. Let's try n=3. Odds are 1+3+5=9, which equals 3 squared=9. Hmm, pattern holds. 

But I need a proof. Maybe I'll try mathematical induction. That's a common technique. 

So, induction goes: base case, induction假设, induction step. Base case: n=1. Sum=
