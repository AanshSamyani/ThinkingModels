Okay, so I have this math problem here: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, I've heard about odd numbers before—they're numbers like 1, 3, 5, etc., right? So, maybe I can start by writing down what these numbers look like. 

Let me list them out. The first odd number is 1, then 3, then 5, 7, 9, and so on. So, if I denote these as O₁, O₂, O₃, etc., each O_k would be 2k -1. Wait, why? Because the nth odd number is 2n-1. For example, O₁ =2*1-1=1, O₂=2*2-1=3, O₃=2*3-1=5, yeah that makes sense. 

So, if I want the sum S of the
