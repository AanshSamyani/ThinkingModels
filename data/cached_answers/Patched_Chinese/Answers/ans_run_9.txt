To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we'll explore both intuitive reasoning and mathematical induction.

**Step 1: Understanding Odd Numbers**

Odd natural numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as \(2k\), where \(k\) is an integer. They come in the form \(2k + 1\). The first few odd natural numbers are: \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\).

**Step 2: Summing Odd Numbers**

Let's denote the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers as \( S_n \).

\( S_n = 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n - 1) \)

**Step 3: Recognizing the Pattern**
