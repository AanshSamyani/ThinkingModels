Alright, so I’ve got this math problem here: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, let me clarify what an odd natural number is. Odd numbers are those integers greater than zero that aren’t divisible by two. So, examples would be 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. The sequence goes like 1, 3, 5, 7,... etc., where each number is two more than the previous. 

Now, I need to find the sum of the first n odd numbers. Let’s denote these numbers. So, the nth odd number would be... Hmm, let me figure out a formula. 

Starting from 1: 
1 = 1
2 = 3
3 =5
4=7
and so on. So, it seems like each nth odd number is equal to
