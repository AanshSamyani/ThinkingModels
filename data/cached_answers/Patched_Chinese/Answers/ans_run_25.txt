Alright, so I’ve got this problem: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me clarify what “the sum of the first n odd natural numbers” means. Odd natural numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., which are odd. So, the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., right? So, if I take these numbers, sum them up, I want to show that it’s equal to n², where n is the number of terms.

Let me try writing down some examples. Maybe that’ll help me understand.

For n=1: The first odd natural number is 1. So, sum=1. According to n²=1²=1. That matches. Good.

For n=2: Sum=1+3
