We want to prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers equals \( n^2 \).

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define Odd Numbers:**
   Odd natural numbers are numbers that can be expressed as \( 2k + 1 \), where \( k \) is a natural number (i.e., \( k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \)).

2. **List the First \( n \) Odd Numbers:**
   The first few odd numbers are:
   \[
   1 = 2(1) - 1, \quad 3 = 2(2) - 1, \quad 5 = 2(3) - 1, \quad \ldots
   \]
   So, the \( n \)-th odd number is:
   \[
   (2n - 1)
   \]
