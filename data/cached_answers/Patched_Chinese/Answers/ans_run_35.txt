Okay, so I have this math problem here: prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, I remember hearing somewhere that there's a neat little formula for that. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand what exactly is meant by "the sum of the first n odd natural numbers." So, odd natural numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., right? So, if I take the first few odd numbers, say n=1,2,3,..., and add them up, I should get a sum. Let me test this for some small values of n.

For n=1: The sum is just 1. According to n², that's 1²=1. So, equality holds.

For n=2: The sum is 1+3=4. And 2²=4. Okay, equality holds
