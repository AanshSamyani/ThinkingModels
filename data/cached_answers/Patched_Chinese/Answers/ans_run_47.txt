Alright, so I've got this problem: prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, okay, let me think about this. 

First, let's clarify what we're talking about. Odd natural numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So, the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., and so on. 

Now, we're supposed to add these numbers together, starting from 1, up to the nth odd number. Let's denote these numbers as O1, O2, O3, ..., On. So, O1 =1, O2=3, O3=5, ..., On=2n-1. 

Okay, so we're trying to prove that O1 + O2 + O3 + ... + On = n². 

Let me think about what happens when we add these
