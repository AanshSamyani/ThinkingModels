Okay, so I have this math problem where I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me think about how I can approach this. Maybe I'll try writing out some examples first to see if I can spot a pattern.

Let's start with n=1. The first odd natural number is just 1. So, sum =1. Is that equal to 1^2? Yeah, 1=1. Cool.

Now, n=2. The first two odd numbers are 1 and 3. Their sum is 1+3=4. Wait, 4 is equal to 2^2. Okay, so far so good.

Let me do n=3. That would be 1+3+5=9. Is 9 equal to 3^2? Yes, indeed. Hmm, seems like a pattern.

What about n=4? That'd be 1+
