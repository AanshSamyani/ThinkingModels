To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), let's proceed step by step.

**Step 1: Understanding Odd Numbers**

The first \( n \) odd natural numbers are:
\[
1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, (2n-1)
\]
This sequence progresses by adding 2 to each subsequent number.

**Step 2: Summing the Sequence**

Let’s denote \( S_n \) as the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers:
\[
S_n = 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n-1)
\]

**Step 3: Pairing Terms**

Pairing the first and last terms:
\[
(1 + (2n-1)),\quad (3 + (2n-3)),\quad \ldots
\]
Each pair sums to
