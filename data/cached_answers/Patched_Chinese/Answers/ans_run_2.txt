Okay, so I have this math problem here: prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I need to understand what constitutes an odd natural number. Odd numbers are numbers that aren't divisible by 2; they're like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So, the sequence of odd natural numbers would be:1,3,5,7,9,... up to the nth term. 

Now, I want to find the sum of these numbers. Let me write down what this sum looks like:1 +3+5+7+...+ (2n-1). Hmm, interesting. Each term is an odd number, and they’re getting bigger as n increases. 

I remember there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, but I'm not sure if it applies here. Wait, maybe arithmetic
