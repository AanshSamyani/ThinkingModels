Okay, so today I came across an interesting math problem: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. At first glance, it seemed a bit tricky, but I thought maybe I could figure it out. Let me walk through my thought process step by step.

So, what exactly is the problem? Well, we're supposed to add up the first n odd numbers. The odd natural numbers start at 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, if n=1, we just have 1; n=2, it's 1+3=4; n=3, 1+3+5=9; n=4, 1+3+5+7=16. Hmm, interesting! So, for n=1,2,3,4, the sums are 1,4,9,16, which are squares. So, maybe there's a pattern
