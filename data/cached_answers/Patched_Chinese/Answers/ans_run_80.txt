Alright, so I've got this math problem here: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.

First off, I need to understand what odd natural numbers are. Odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., which aren't divisible by 2. So, they're numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when you divide them by 2. Got it.

Now, the problem wants me to find the sum of these numbers. So, if I consider the first few odd numbers, let's say n=1,2,3,4. Let me jot down those:

For n=1: Just 1.
Sum =1

For n=2:1+3=4

For n=3:1+3+5=9

For n=4:1+3+5+7=16
