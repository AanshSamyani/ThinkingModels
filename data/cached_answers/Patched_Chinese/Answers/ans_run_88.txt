Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, what are odd natural numbers? Well, they are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., which aren't divisible by 2. So, each odd number can be expressed as 2k+1 where k is a natural number. 

So, the first few odd numbers are:
- When k=0: 2*0+1 =1
- When k=1:2*1+1=3
- When k=2:2*2+1=5
- And so on.

Now, I need to add the first n odd numbers. Let's denote the nth odd number as (2n-1), which makes sense because:
- For n=1:2*1-1=1
- For n
