Okay, so I’ve got this math problem: prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, alright. Let me think about how to tackle this.

First, let me clarify what's meant by "the sum of the first n odd natural numbers." Odd natural numbers—so we're talking about numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. Now, odd numbers aren’t consecutive—that's confusing—wait, actually, they are. Wait, no. No, wait.
