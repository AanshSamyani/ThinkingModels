Okay, so I have this problem where I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, sounds interesting. Let me think about how to approach this. 

Alright, let's jot down what I know. The odd natural numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., right? So, basically, they're numbers that can't be divided evenly; they leave a remainder when divided by 2. Got it. So, we're talking about adding up these numbers, starting from 1, up to the nth odd number.

Let me denote each term. Let’s say:
- The first odd natural number: 1
- The second: 3
- The third: 5
- And so on...
So, intuitively, I’m looking at a sequence: 1 + 3 + 5 + … + (2n-1). Hmm, why? Because each odd
