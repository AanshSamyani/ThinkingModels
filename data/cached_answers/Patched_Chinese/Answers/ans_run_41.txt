Okay, so I'm trying to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me think about how I'd approach this. Maybe I'll start by writing out what the first few odd numbers look like. 

Odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., right? So, if n=1, the sum should be just 1. For n=2, it's 1+3=4. Wait, 4 is 2 squared. Okay, so far so good. Let me try n=3. The sum would be 1+3+5=9, which is 3 squared. Okay, interesting. Now n=4:1+3+5+7=16, which is 4 squared. So, it seems that the sum increases nicely.

Now, I need to generalize this. Maybe I'll consider how each odd number relates. The
