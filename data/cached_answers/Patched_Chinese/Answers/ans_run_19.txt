Okay, so I'm trying to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, let's list out what the odd natural numbers are. The first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, for any natural number n, the nth odd number can be expressed somehow. Maybe there's a formula for generating odd numbers? Wait, I remember something—yes, each odd number can be written as 2k - 1, where k is a natural number. So, for k=1, we get 1; k=2 gives us 3, etc. That makes sense.

So, if we're talking about the sum of the first n odd numbers, it's going to be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1). Hmm, okay. Now, I wonder if there's a straightforward
