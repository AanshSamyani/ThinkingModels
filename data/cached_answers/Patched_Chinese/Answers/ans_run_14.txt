Okay, so I have this math problem: prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. 

First, let's understand what odd numbers are. Odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., where they’re not divisible by 2. So, the nth odd number is... hmm. Wait, maybe I should jot down the first few odd numbers to see the pattern. 

The first odd number is 1. 
The second odd number is 3. 
The third odd number is 5. 
The fourth odd number is 7. 

Oh, I see. So, each odd number increases by 2. That means we're dealing with an arithmetic sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is 2. 

Now, I remember that the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (a1 + an
