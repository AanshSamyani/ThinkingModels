Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me think. Maybe I'll start by recalling what odd numbers are. Odd numbers are numbers that aren't divisible by 2, right? So they're like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. 

Let me list out the first few odd numbers to see a pattern. 
1st odd number: 1
2nd odd number: 3
3rd odd number: 5
4th odd number:7
5th odd number:9

So, if I add them up:
1 +3 =4
4+5=9
9+7=16
16+9=25
And so on. 

Wait, these sums are 1,4,9,16,25,... which are perfect squares. So, it looks like the sum S(n) =
