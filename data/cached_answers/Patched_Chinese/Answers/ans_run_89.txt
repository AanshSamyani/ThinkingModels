Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me think about how odd numbers are structured. Each odd number can be written as 2k + 1, where k starts at 0. So, the sequence goes: 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. 

Let me try adding some of them up to see if there's a pattern. 

For n=1: sum=1. Which is 1^2=1. Okay, that works.

For n=2:1+3=4. Which is 2^2=4. Good.

For n=3:1+3+5=9. That's 3^2=9. Still holds.

For n=4:1+3+5+7=16. Which is 4^2=16. So, seems consistent.

Now, I want a
