Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me recall what odd natural numbers are. Odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., where each subsequent odd number increases by 2. So, the nth odd number can be represented as 2n-1. Wait, let me verify that. For n=1, it's 2*1-1=1; n=2, it's 2*2-1=3; yeah, that makes sense. So, each odd number can be written as 2n-1.

Now, I need to find the sum of the first n odd numbers. That means I'm adding up the numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the nth odd number. Let's denote this sum as S.
