Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, let me recall what odd natural numbers are. Odd numbers are numbers that aren't divisible by 2. So they're like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So, the first few odd numbers are:1,3,5,7... Okay, got that.

Now, I need to sum up these numbers up to the nth odd number. So, for example, if n=1, sum=1; n=2, sum=1+3=4; n=3, sum=1+3+5=9; n=4, sum=1+3+5+7=16; etc. Hmm, I notice that these sums are perfect squares:1=1²,4=2²,9=3²
