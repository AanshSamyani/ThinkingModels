Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n². Hmm, let me think about how I can approach this. Maybe I can start by listing out the first few odd numbers and see if I notice a pattern.

The first odd natural number is 1. Okay, let's add that: sum = 1.

The second odd number is 3. Adding that, sum = 1 + 3 = 4.

The third odd number is 5. Summing them: 4 + 5 = 9.

Fourth odd number:7. Sum:9+7=16.

第五:9. Adding:16+9=25.

第六:11. Sum:25+11=36.

Okay, so the sums are:1,4,9,16,25,36... These numbers look familiar; they're perfect squares! So,
