Okay, so I'm trying to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let's see. The odd numbers are like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So, maybe I should list them out for some values of n to see if it makes sense.

Let's start with n=1. That should just be 1. And 1^2=1. Okay, matches. Now, n=2. So, 1 + 3=4. Which is 2^2=4. Good. n=3:1+3+5=9. That's 3^2=9. Hmm, so far, it works. Maybe n=4:1+3+5+7=16. That's 4^2=16. Yeah, seems consistent.

Now, trying to think why this might be true. Maybe there's a pattern or
