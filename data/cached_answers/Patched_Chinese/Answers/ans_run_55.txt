Okay, so I've got this math problem here: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, alright, let's try to unpack this step by step. 

First, let me just write down what I know. Odd natural numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So, the sequence goes: 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., up to the nth odd number. We're supposed to sum these up and show that the result is n². 

Let me denote the nth odd number. Since they're spaced by 2, starting from 1, I can express it as: 

Odd numbers = 2k - 1, where k = 1, 2, 3, ..., n.

So, each odd number can be expressed as twice some integer minus one. That seems right. 

So, our sequence is: 2(1
