Okay, so I have this math problem here: prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, alright, let me see how I can tackle this.

First, let me make sure I understand what the problem is asking. The odd natural numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So, we're supposed to add up these numbers starting from 1, going up by 2 each time, and find out if that sum equals n squared, where n is some natural number.

Let me think about some examples. Maybe if I plug in small values of n, I can see a pattern.

When n=1: sum =1. Which is equal to 1^2=1. Okay, that works.

When n=2: sum=1+3=4, which is 2^2=4. Also works.

When n=3: sum=1+3
