Okay, so I've got this math problem: prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let's see. Odd numbers, okay, so they're numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., right? So the first n odd numbers would be: 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the nth odd number. 

Let me list them out. If n=1, it's just 1. If n=2, it's 1+3=4. If n=3, it's 1+3+5=9. Hmm, interesting. So, 1=1, 1+3=4,1+3+5=9. So, they're squares. Like, n=1,1^2=1; n=2,2^2=4; n=3,3^2=9. Okay, so
