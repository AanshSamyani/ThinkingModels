To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), let's proceed step-by-step.

**Step 1: Understand Odd Numbers**

Odd natural numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. The sequence of odd numbers is: 
\[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots\]

**Step 2: Write Down the First few Odd Numbers**

Let’s consider the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers:
\[ S_n = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + \ldots + (2n-1) \]

**Step 3: Sum Formula**

We aim to prove:
\[ S_n = n^2 \]

**Step 4: Mathematical Proof**

Let’s derive the formula:

1. **Inductive Approach**:
   - **Base Case**: Let \( n = 1 \).
