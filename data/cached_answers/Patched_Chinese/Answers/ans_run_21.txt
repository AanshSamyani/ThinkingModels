Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, I remember something about triangular numbers. Let me think. Odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., right? So, if I want the sum of these numbers, maybe there's a pattern.

Let me try adding a few examples. If n=1, then the sum is just 1. Which is 1^2, so that works. If n=2, then 1+3=4. Which is 2^2. Okay, works. n=3:1+3+5=9. Again, 3^2. So, looks like it works. But I need a proof, not just examples.

Wait, I think there's a formula for triangular numbers. triangular number formula: T_n = (n*(n+1))/2. Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.
