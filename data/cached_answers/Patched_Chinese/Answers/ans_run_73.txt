Okay, so today I came across this math problem: prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. At first glance, it seems pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand each step clearly.

Let me start by recalling what odd natural numbers are. Odd numbers are numbers that aren't divisible by 2. So, examples are 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. The nth odd number can be expressed as 2n-1. Let me verify that: For n=1, it's 2(1)-1=1; n=2, it's 2(2)-1=3; n=3, it's 2(3)-1=5. Yeah, that checks out.

So, if I want to find the sum of the first n odd numbers, I need to sum up numbers like 1,3,5,... up to the nth term. Math
