Sure! Let's prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).

**Proof:**

First, let's understand what an odd natural number is. Odd numbers are numbers that cannot be divided evenly by 2. They are sequences like: \(1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots\).

The **k**th odd natural number is given by:
\[
2k - 1
\]
where \(k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\)

Now, let's consider the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers:
\[
S = 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n - 1)
\]

We can express \( S \) as:
\[
S = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)
\]

Let's
