To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we'll proceed step-by-step.

**Definitions:**
- The **odd natural numbers** are: \(1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots\)
- The **sum** of these numbers up to \( n \) terms: \(1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n-1)\)

**Proof:**

1. **Base Cases:**
   - For \(n = 1\):
     \[
     \text{Sum} = 1 = 1^2
     \]
   - For \(n = 2\):
     \[
     \text{Sum} = 1 + 3 = 4 = 2^2
     \]
   - For \(n = 3\):
     \[
     \text{Sum} =
