Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, let me recall what odd natural numbers are. They are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., which are not divisible by 2. So, the sequence goes: 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., where each subsequent number increases by 2.

So, I need to add up the first n terms of this sequence. Let's denote these odd numbers as a1, a2, ..., an. So, a1 = 1, a2 = 3, a3 = 5, and so on. 

Now, I want to find S = a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + an = S(n). 

To find S(n), I'll try to find a formula. Maybe induction? Or
