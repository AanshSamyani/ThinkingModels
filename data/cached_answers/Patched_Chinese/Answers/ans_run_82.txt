Alright, so I’ve got this math problem here: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, what do we mean by odd natural numbers? Well, they’re numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, the sequence goes:1,3,5,7,9,... Got it. Now, we’re supposed to add the first n numbers in this sequence. That means we’re adding1+3+5+7+...+2n-1. Wait, why2n-1? Oh, because odd numbers can be expressed as2n-1, wheren starts at1. So, okay, so our sum S =1+3+5+...+(2n-1). 

Now, I need to prove that S equalsn squared. Hmm. Maybe I can start by trying
