Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, what are odd natural numbers? Well, odd numbers are those that aren't divisible by 2, so they're like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. Now, I need to add them up and see if it's equal to n². Let me try doing that for small values of n to see if it works.

For n=1: sum=1. n²=1²=1. That works.

For n=2: sum=1+3=4. n²=2²=4. Still works.

For n=3: sum=1+3+5=9. n²=3²=9. Okay, so
