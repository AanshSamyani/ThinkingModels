Okay, so today I've got this math problem: prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, sounds interesting! Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what odd natural numbers are. Odd numbers are numbers that aren't divisible by 2. So, they’re like 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. So, the sequence of odd numbers is 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the nth odd number. Now, I need to sum these numbers up and show that the total is equal to n squared. 

Let me write down some examples to get a feel for it. Maybe it'll help me see a pattern.

For n=1: Just the first odd number, which is 1. So, sum=1. According to n squared: 1²=1. That works.

For n=2
