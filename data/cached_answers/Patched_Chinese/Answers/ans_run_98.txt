Okay, so I’ve got this math problem to figure out: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, alright. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., right? So they're every odd number you’d count. If I’m talking about the sum of the first n odd numbers, that means I’d add up 1, then 3, then 5, and so on, up to the nth odd number. Wait, actually, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Are we talking about the nth odd natural number? Or are we just summing n odd numbers? Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Let’s say we’re talking about the nth odd natural number. Wait, no. Wait, natural numbers go 1,2,3,4… So odd natural numbers would be 1,3
