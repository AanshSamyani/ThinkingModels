Okay, so I've got this math problem: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to tackle this. 

Alright, so odd numbers... Starting from 1,3,5,... up to something. But here, it's talking about the sum. So maybe I should try summing them up for some small values of n and see if it holds.

Let me try n=1:1. Sum=1. Is 1 equal to 1²? Yes, 1=1. Okay, simple.

n=2:1+3=4. Which is 2²=4. Nice.

n=3:1+3+5=9. Hmm,3²=9. Still works.

n=4:1+3+5+7=16.4²=16. Seems okay.

So, empirically, it holds for these cases. But
