Okay, so I'm trying to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me think. 

First, I know that odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., so they're numbers that aren't divisible by 2. And the sum of these numbers... Oh, I remember somewhere that maybe there's a formula for this. 

Wait, I think it says that the sum is n squared. So, for example, if n is 1, the sum is 1, which is 1 squared. If n is 2, 1+3=4, which is 2 squared. For n=3, 1+3+5=9, which is 3 squared. Okay, so it seems like a pattern. But how do I prove it?

Maybe I can think about induction. Let's try that. 

First, base case: n=
