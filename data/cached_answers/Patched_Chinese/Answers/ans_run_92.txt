Alright, so I've got this math problem here: prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, okay, let me think about how I'd tackle this. Maybe I'll start by recalling what an odd number is. Odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., right? So, they're numbers that can't be divided evenly by 2; they leave a remainder of 1.

Now, the question is asking about the sum of the first n odd numbers. So, for example, if n=1, the sum is just 1. If n=2, it's 1+3=4. If n=3, it's 1+3+5=9. Hmm, I notice that these sums are 1,4,9... Wait, those are squares! So, maybe the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared. That seems plausible
