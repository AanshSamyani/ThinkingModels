Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me think. Maybe I'll start by listing out some examples to see if it holds.

Starting with n=1: The first odd natural number is 1. So, sum=1. According to n^2=1^2=1. That checks out. Good.

n=2: The numbers are 1 and 3. Their sum is 1+3=4. Which is 2^2=4. That works too.

n=3: Numbers are 1,3,5. Sum=1+3+5=9. Which is 3^2=9. Okay, so far so good.

n=4: Numbers are 1,3,5,7. Sum=1+3+5+7=16. Which is 4^2=16. Alright, so far
