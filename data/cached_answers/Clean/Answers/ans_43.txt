Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's list out the first few odd natural numbers to see if there's a pattern. The first odd number is 1, then 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, the sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. If I add these up, maybe I can spot something interesting.

Let's start with n=1: the sum is 1, which is 1 squared. Okay, that works. What about n=2? The sum is 1+3=4, which is 2 squared. Still works. For n=3, the sum is 1+3+5=9, which is 3 squared. Nice, that seems consistent so far.

Now, let's try n=4: 1+3+5+7=16, which is 4 squared. Okay, that's another one that checks out. So, the pattern seems to hold for these small numbers. I guess the general idea is that the sum of these odd numbers is always a square number.

But how do I actually prove this? Maybe I can use mathematical induction. That's a common method for proving statements that are supposed to hold for all natural numbers. So, let me set that up.

Base case: n=1. Sum is 1, which is 1 squared. So, the base case holds.

Now, let's assume that the statement is true for some integer k. That is, assume that the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is k squared. I need to show that then, the sum of the first k+1 odd natural numbers is (k+1) squared.

Let's denote the k+1 th odd number as 2(k+1) -1. Wait, why? Let me think. The nth odd number can be represented as 2n -1. So, for the k+1 th term, n=k+1. Therefore, the term is 2(k+1) -1 = 2k +2 -1 = 2k+1.

So, adding that to the sum, we have sum_{i=1}^{k+1} (2i -1) = sum_{i=1}^k (2i -1) + (2(k+1) -1).

By our induction hypothesis, the sum up to k is k squared. So, sum_{i=1}^k (2i -1) = k². Then, adding the (k+1)th term, which is 2k+1, gives k² + (2k +1) = k² +2k +1.

Hmm, k squared plus 2k plus 1 is a familiar expression. That factors into (k+1) squared, right? Because (k+1)² = k² + 2k +1. So, indeed, the sum up to k+1 is (k+1) squared.

So, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n. Therefore, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared.

Wait, let me just double-check this reasoning. The induction step seems solid: assuming the sum up to k is k squared, adding the next odd number, which is 2k+1, gives k² +2k +1, which is (k+1)^2. Yep, that makes sense. So, I think this proof is solid.

Another way to think about it is using visual representations or geometric interpretations, but since the induction proof worked out, maybe that's sufficient. But if I were to visualize it, each odd number can be thought of as a layer that adds to form a square. For example, the first odd number is 1, which is a single square. Adding 3 makes a 2x2 square, adding 5 makes a 3x3 square, and so on. Each time you add the next odd number, you're effectively completing the next layer of the square.

This might not be a formal proof, but it provides some intuitive understanding why the sum of these numbers forms a perfect square. Still, since induction gives a general proof that it works for any natural number n, it should be sufficient.

So, in conclusion, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed equal to n squared. That seems to align perfectly with the examples we tried earlier, reinforcing the validity of the proof.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Base Case:**
For \( n = 1 \):
The sum is \( 1 \), which is \( 1^2 \). Thus, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that the statement is true for some integer \( k \), i.e., the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \).

Now, consider the sum of the first \( k+1 \) odd natural numbers:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} (2i - 1) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{k} (2i - 1) \right) + (2(k+1) - 1)
\]
By the induction hypothesis:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k} (2i - 1) = k^2
\]
Adding the \( (k+1) \)-th term:
\[
k^2 + (2k + 2 - 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
\]
Thus, the statement holds for \( k+1 \).

**Conclusion:**
By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

\[
\boxed{\text{The sum of the first } n \text{ odd natural numbers is } n^2}
