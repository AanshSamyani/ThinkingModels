Okay, so I have this problem that says I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, interesting. Let me think about how to approach this.

First off, what are the first n odd natural numbers? Well, natural numbers are just the positive integers, like 1, 2, 3, and so on. Odd numbers are the ones that aren't divisible by 2, so they start at 1 and go up by 2 each time. So the first few odd numbers would be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. So, if I need the first n of these, I guess it would be 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the nth odd number.

Let me write that down:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., (2n - 1)

So the last term is 2n - 1. That makes sense because each subsequent odd number increases by 2, starting from 1.

Now, I need to find the sum of these terms and show that it equals n squared. So the sum S is:

S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + ... + (2n - 1)

Alright, let me think about how to compute this sum. I remember there are formulas for the sum of arithmetic series, but let me not jump to that yet because maybe there's a pattern or a visual proof I can come up with.

Wait, actually, when you look at the odd numbers, they form a sequence where each term is the previous term plus 2. So that's an arithmetic sequence with the first term a = 1 and common difference d = 2.

I also remember that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be found by the formula:

S = (n/2) * [2a + (n - 1)d]

Let me plug in the values I have into this formula.

Here, a = 1, d = 2, so:

S = (n/2) * [2*1 + (n - 1)*2]
S = (n/2) * [2 + 2n - 2]
S = (n/2) * (2n)
S = (n/2) * 2n
S = n * n
S = n²

Oh, wow, that works out perfectly! So using the arithmetic series formula gave me the result I needed.

But just to make sure, maybe I can try adding some specific numbers and see if it holds. Let's take n = 1.

Sum = 1
According to the formula, 1² = 1. Okay, that matches.

Now n = 2.

Sum = 1 + 3 = 4
2² = 4. That's correct.

n = 3.

Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
3² = 9. Perfect.

n = 4.

Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
4² = 16. Yep, works.

Seems solid. But wait, maybe I can visualize this. Sometimes seeing it helps more.

Imagine you have a square with side length n. Each layer around it adds an odd number of squares. The first layer is 1, the next is 3, then 5, and so on. Adding all these layers gives you a square of side n, which means the area is n². That makes sense!

So, not only does the arithmetic sequence formula work, but there's also a geometric interpretation. That gives me more confidence that the formula is correct.

Is there another way to think about it? Maybe by induction? Let's try that too.

Mathematical induction is a method where I prove the base case and then assume it's true for some k and prove it for k+1.

Base case: n=1.

Sum =1, which is 1². So it holds.

Assume it's true for n=k. So sum up to k is k².

Now, consider n=k+1. The sum would be k² + (2(k+1) - 1) = k² + (2k + 2 - 1) = k² + 2k +1 = (k +1)². Which is true.

So by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.

Alright, so I've approached this problem in a few different ways: using the arithmetic series formula, verifying with specific numbers, visualizing with squares, and even using mathematical induction. All of these methods lead me to the same conclusion that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared. I feel confident about this now!

**Final Answer**
The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), so the result is \boxed{n^2}.
</think>

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use the following approaches:

1. **Arithmetic Series Formula**:
   - The first \( n \) odd natural numbers form an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a = 1 \) and common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
     \[
     S = \frac{n}{2} \times [2a + (n - 1)d]
     \]
   - Plugging in the values \( a = 1 \) and \( d = 2 \):
     \[
     S = \frac{n}{2} \times [2 \times 1 + (n - 1) \times 2]
     \]
     \[
     S = \frac{n}{2} \times [2 + 2n - 2]
     \]
     \[
     S = \frac{n}{2} \times 2n
     \]
     \[
     S = n \times n
     \]
     \[
     S = n^2
     \]

2. **Geometric Interpretation**:
   - Visualizing the odd numbers as layers around a square, each subsequent layer adds an odd number of squares, forming a larger square with side length \( n \).
   - This geometric interpretation confirms that the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers forms a perfect square.

3. **Mathematical Induction**:
   - **Base case**: For \( n = 1 \), the sum is 1, which is \( 1^2 \).
   - **Inductive step**: Assume the sum is \( k^2 \) for some \( k \). Then for \( k + 1 \):
     \[
     \text{Sum} = k^2 + (2(k + 1) - 1)
     \]
     \[
     = k^2 + 2k + 1
     \]
     \[
     = (k + 1)^2
     \]
   - Thus, the formula holds for \( k + 1 \).

Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), so the result is \boxed{n^2}.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
