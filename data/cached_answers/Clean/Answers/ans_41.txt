Alright, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can start by writing down what the first few odd numbers are and their sums, and then see if I can find a pattern or a formula.

The first odd natural number is 1. Okay, sum of one number: 1.

The second odd number is 3. Sum now: 1 + 3 = 4.

The third is 5. Sum: 4 + 5 = 9.

Fourth: 7. Sum: 9 + 7 = 16.

Wait, 1, 4, 9, 16... those are perfect squares! So is this a coincidence or is there a formula behind it? Hmm.

Let me try to express the nth term of the sequence of odd numbers. The first term is 1, the second is 3, third is 5, so the nth term would be 2n - 1. Let me verify: when n=1, 2(1)-1=1, correct. n=2, 2(2)-1=3, correct. n=3, 5, good. So the nth odd number is 2n -1.

Now, to find the sum S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n -1). Hmm, how can I express this sum? Maybe I can use mathematical induction? Or find a formula.

I remember that the sum of the first n odd numbers is indeed n². But why is that? Maybe there's a way to visualize it or see a pattern.

Let me try to write out the sum in a different order to see if that helps. Or perhaps use a geometric interpretation.

Wait, another idea: using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Since the odd numbers form an arithmetic sequence with first term a=1 and common difference d=2.

The formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d].

Plugging in a=1 and d=2: S = n/2 * [2*1 + (n-1)*2] = n/2 * [2 + 2n - 2] = n/2 * (2n) = n².

Oh, that's neat! So using the arithmetic series formula gives me the result directly. Maybe that's a simpler way than trying to see the pattern empirically and then trying to generalize.

Alternatively, I can use mathematical induction. Let's try that as well to confirm.

Base case: n=1. Sum is 1. 1²=1. So base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume that the sum of the first k odd numbers is k². Now, let's consider the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers. That would be k² + (2(k+1) -1) = k² + (2k + 2 -1) = k² + 2k +1. Which is (k+1)². So it holds for k+1.

Thus, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.

Hmm, so I have three methods: one by calculating the sum, another by using the arithmetic series formula, and the third by induction. All three confirm that the sum of the first n odd numbers is indeed n squared. I think that's solid.

But wait, maybe I can visualize the sum of odd numbers as blocks. Each odd number adds a layer of blocks, making a square. Starting with 1 block, then adding 3 to make 4 blocks, then 5 to make 9, etc. That kind of visual makes sense, showing how each step completes a larger square.

So, all methods converge on the same conclusion, reinforcing that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers equals \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Base Case:**  
For \( n = 1 \), the sum is 1, which equals \( 1^2 = 1 \). Thus, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**  
Assume the sum holds for some integer \( k \geq 1 \), i.e., the sum of the first \( k \) odd numbers is \( k^2 \).  
For \( k + 1 \), the sum is \( k^2 + (2(k + 1) - 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2 \).  
Thus, the sum holds for \( k + 1 \).

By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
