Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared, so that's S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n².

First off, I remember that odd numbers are numbers that can be expressed as 2k + 1, where k is a non-negative integer. So the first few odd numbers are 1 (when k=0), 3 (k=1), 5 (k=2), and so on.

Now, the sum S is the accumulation of these numbers from k=0 up to k=n-1. So, S = Σ (2k + 1) from k=0 to n-1. I think this is the right way to represent it.

Let me try to split the summation into two separate parts: the sum of 2k and the sum of 1. So, S = Σ 2k + Σ 1. The sum of 2k from k=0 to n-1 is just 2 times the sum of k from 0 to n-1, right? And the sum of 1, n times, because I'm adding 1 a total of n times.

I recall that the sum of the first m natural numbers is m(m + 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me check for small m. If m=3, sum is 0+1+2+3 = 6, which is 3(3 + 1)/2 = 6. Yeah, that works. So, sum from k=0 to n-1 of k is (n-1)n/2. Therefore, the sum of 2k is 2*(n-1)n/2 = n(n - 1). Similarly, the sum of 1, n times, is just n.

So, putting it all together: S = n(n - 1) + n = n² - n + n = n². So, that's the proof.

Wait, but let me double-check. If n=1, sum is 1. Plugging into n², 1²=1. Correct. n=2, sum is 1+3=4, which is 2²=4. Good. n=3, sum is 1+3+5=9, and 3²=9. Yep, that's right. Maybe I can think of it another way.

What if I group the numbers differently? For example, 1+3=4, 5+7=12, 9+11=20, and so on. Hmm, not immediately obvious how that would relate to n². But maybe another approach: writing the sum as pairs.

Wait, for odd numbers, they form consecutive pairs without leftovers when grouped in a certain way. Alternatively, if I pair the first number with the last, 1 with (2n-1), their sum is 2n. Similarly, the second number with the second last, 3 with (2n-3), their sum is also 2n. This continues until the middle of the sequence. So, each pair adds up to 2n, and the number of such pairs is n, because each pair consists of two numbers.

Therefore, the total sum is n*(2n) divided by 2? Wait, no, that's not correct. If each pair adds to 2n and there are n pairs, then the total sum should be n*(2n)/2 = n². That actually makes sense.

Wait, let me clarify. If you pair 1 + (2n -1)=2n, 3 + (2n -3)=2n, ..., up to the middle. How many such pairs are there? Well, if n is the number of terms, then for each pair, you have two terms, so the number of pairs is n/2. But this only makes sense when n is even. If n is odd, there's a middle term, which is 2*(n//2) +1, but regardless, the sum of each pair is 2n, and the number of pairs is essentially n, because each term is in one pair.

So, in that case, sum S = n*(2n)/2 =n². So, that's another way to see it.

Alternatively, I can visualize the sum. The sum of odd numbers forms a square. For example, the first odd number is 1, which is 1x1. The first two odd numbers sum to 4, which is 2x2. The first three sum to 9, which is 3x3, and so on. This visual representation suggests that each addition of an odd number corresponds to building up a square.

Maybe another mathematical approach: using induction. Let's see. Base case: n=1. Sum is 1=1². True.

Inductive step: Assume that for some k≥1, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k². Now, consider the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers, which is k² + (2k+1). According to the inductive hypothesis, that would be k² + 2k +1 = (k+1)². Therefore, the statement holds for k+1. By induction, it holds for all positive integers n.

So, either through algebraic manipulation, grouping, or mathematical induction, we've shown that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps in the algebraic proof. Starting from S = Σ (2k +1) from k=0 to n-1.

First term, when k=0: 2(0) +1 =1.

Second term, k=1: 3.

Third term, k=2:5.

So, the sum becomes 1+3+5+...+(2n-1).

Expressed as two sums: S = 2*Σk from k=0 to n-1 + Σ1 from k=0 to n-1.

The sum of Σk from 0 to n-1 is (n-1)n/2.

Multiplying by 2: 2*(n-1)n/2 =n(n-1).

Sum of Σ1 from k=0 to n-1 is n*1 =n.

Adding together: n(n-1) +n =n² -n +n =n².

Yes, that checks out. So, algebraic method gives the same result.

But just to be thorough, let me compute this for n=4.

First four odd numbers:1,3,5,7. Sum:1+3=4, +5=9, +7=16. 16 is 4². Correct.

Another example: n=5.

1+3=4, +5=9, +7=16, +9=25. Which is 5². Perfect.

Wait, I just thought of another way: in an arithmetic sequence, the sum can be calculated as (number of terms)/2*(first term + last term). Let's see.

Here, first term a1=1, last term an=2n-1, number of terms n.

So, sum S= n/2*(1 + (2n-1))=n/2*(2n)=n².

Exactly. That's another formulaic approach.

Alternatively, if I consider the difference between consecutive squares.

Let's see:

n² - (n-1)² =n² - (n² -2n +1)=2n -1.

So, the difference between n² and (n-1)² is 2n-1, which is the nth odd number.

Therefore, if we sum these differences from n=1 to n=k, we get the sum of the first k odd numbers is k².

This is another intuitive way to see why it's true.

Alternatively, geometrically, a square of side length n can be partitioned into a square of side length n-1, and the area of the new square being an extra layer. The extra layer corresponds to the nth odd number, which is 2n-1. Hence, adding up these layers gives n².

All these methods confirm the same result: the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared.

Just to make sure, what if n=0? Well, the problem specifies the first n odd numbers, but for n=0, the sum would be zero, which is 0²=0. But since n=0 might not be considered here, it's fine.

Also, for non-integer n? Hmm, but the problem specifically refers to natural numbers, which are positive integers. So, n must be a positive integer.

I think I've covered multiple approaches: algebraic manipulation, grouping, induction, arithmetic series formula, difference of squares, and geometric interpretation. All methods lead to the conclusion that the sum is n squared. So, I'm confident in this proof.

Now, let's provide a clear step-by-step proof of the statement that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals \( n^2 \).

**Proof:**

We aim to prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \). The first \( n \) odd natural numbers are \( 1, 3, 5, \ldots, (2n - 1) \).

Consider the sum \( S \):

\[
S = 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n - 1)
\]

We can represent each term in the sum as \( 2k + 1 \), where \( k \) is an integer starting from 0:

\[
S = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 1)
\]

This sum can be split into two separate sums:

\[
S = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2k + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1
\]

Compute each part separately.

**First Sum:**

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2k = 2 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k
\]

The sum \( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \) is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers starting from 0. Using the formula for the sum of the first \( m \) natural numbers:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{m} k = \frac{m(m + 1)}{2}
\]

However, since we are summing from 0 to \( n - 1 \):

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n - 1} k = \frac{(n - 1)n}{2}
\]

Therefore:

\[
2 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k = 2 \cdot \frac{(n - 1)n}{2} = n(n - 1)
\]

**Second Sum:**

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1 = n \cdot 1 = n
\]

**Combine Both Sums:**

\[
S = n(n - 1) + n = n^2 - n + n = n^2
\]

Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is indeed \( n^2 \).

**Alternative Proof Using Arithmetic Series:**

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
\]

Where:
- \( n \) is the number of terms,
- \( a_1 \) is the first term,
- \( a_n \) is the last term.

For the first \( n \) odd numbers:
- \( a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_n = 2n - 1 \)

Substitute into the formula:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (1 + (2n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (2n) = n^2
\]

Hence, proven that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

**Proof by Mathematical Induction:**

To prove this statement using mathematical induction:

1. **Base Case (n = 1):**

   The first odd number is 1.

   \[
   S = 1 = 1^2 = 1
   \]

   The base case holds.

2. **Inductive Step:**

   Assume that for some integer \( k \geq 1 \), the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \):

   \[
   S_k = 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) = k^2
   \]

   We need to show that the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd natural numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 \):

   \[
   S_{k+1} = S_k + (2(k + 1) - 1) = k^2 + (2k + 1)
   \]

   Simplify the expression:

   \[
   S_{k+1} = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
   \]

   Thus, the inductive step holds.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \( n \).

**Conclusion:**

Through algebraic manipulation, the arithmetic series formula, and mathematical induction, we have proven that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers equals \( n^2 \).
