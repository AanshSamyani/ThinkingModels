Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I have this problem that says I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me see if I can figure this out. 

First off, what are odd natural numbers? They are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, right? So the first few odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. I need to add up the first n of these numbers and show that the result is n squared.

Let me try writing down a few sums to see if I can spot a pattern.

If n = 1, the first odd number is just 1. So the sum is 1. And 1 squared is 1. So that checks out.

If n = 2, the first two odd numbers are 1 and 3. Adding them gives 1 + 3 = 4. Which is equal to 2 squared, since 2^2 = 4. That works too.

For n = 3, the first three odd numbers are 1, 3, 5. The sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. And 3 squared is 9, so that's correct as well.

n = 4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. That's 4^2, which is 16. So far, so good.

n = 5: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25. 5^2 is 25. Okay, now I'm convinced it works for these small numbers. But how do I prove it for any n?

I remember something about arithmetic series, maybe that can help. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by n*(a1 + an)/2, where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. 

In this case, the first term a1 is 1, and the last term an is... what's the nth term of the odd numbers? Well, since each term increases by 2, the nth term is a1 + (n-1)*2. So a1 is 1, so an becomes 1 + 2*(n-1) which simplifies to 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n -1. 

So, plugging into the arithmetic series formula, the sum S would be n*(1 + (2n -1))/2. Let me compute that.

1 + 2n -1 = 2n, so S = n*(2n)/2 = n*(n) = n^2. 

Oh! That worked out. So the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. Let me go through it again more slowly.

The first n odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n - 1).

Sum S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n -1)

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n*(a1 + an)/2.

a1 is 1, an is the nth term of the odd numbers, which is 2n -1.

So S = n*(1 + (2n -1))/2.

Simplify numerator: 1 + 2n -1 = 2n.

Thus, S = n*(2n)/2 = n^2.

So, algebraically, it all adds up. Therefore, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared.

But wait, maybe there's another way to look at it, like using mathematical induction. Let me try that as well to see if it holds.

For mathematical induction, I need to show two things: that the statement is true for the base case (n=1), and that if it's true for some integer k, then it's also true for k+1.

We already know it's true for n=1: sum =1 =1^2.

Assume it's true for n=k: sum of first k odds =k^2.

Then for n=k+1, the sum would be the sum of first k odds plus the (k+1)th odd number.

We already know the sum up to k is k^2, so we need to add the next odd number, which is 2k+1.

Therefore, sum up to k+1 is k^2 + (2k+1).

Simplify: k^2 + 2k +1 = (k +1)^2.

Which is exactly what we wanted. Thus, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.

So, both algebraically and by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared. That makes me confident that the statement is true.

Another way I can think of is pairing the numbers. If I write the numbers as 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n-1), and pair them up:

1 + (2n-1) = 2n

3 + (2n-3) = 2n

...

Each pair adds up to 2n, and there are n pairs.

Wait, but when n is odd, there's a middle term. For example, when n=3: 1 + 3 +5 =9. 1 +5=6, plus 3 is 9. Or when n=4:1+3+5+7=16. Pairing 1+7=8, 3+5=8, so 2 pairs each summing to 8. That works.

When n is even, say n=4: 1+7=8, 3+5=8. Then, each pair is 8, and with two pairs, 16.

So in both cases, the sum is n pairs of 2n, each, so n * 2n? Wait, no. Wait, if each pair sums to 2n and there are n pairs, then the total sum is n * 2n? Wait, no.

Wait, no, wait: if there are n terms, which when paired is n/2 pairs? Wait, n=4, pairs are two pairs, each of 2 terms: 8 +8=16.

But for general n: if n is even, the number of pairs is n/2, each summing to 2n.

Wait, maybe not. Let's try n=5: 1+3+5+7+9=25. Number of terms is 5. If I pair them:1+9=10,3+7=10, and the middle term is 5. So 10+10+5=25.

Alternatively, number of pairs: (5-1)/2=2 pairs with 5 terms, and then the middle term.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Maybe it's better not to rely on this approach, but instead stick to the initial methods I used.

But I see that using the arithmetic series formula works and also via induction.

Alternatively, I know there's a pattern in the sums. For n=1, sum=1=1^2. For n=2, sum=4=2^2. For n=3, sum=9=3^2. For n=4, sum=16=4^2. So for these, each time the sum equals n squared. So it seems to hold up.

Is there another way to see why the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared? Hmm.

One thought is that the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2. Maybe if I compare it to the sum of the first n odd numbers.

Wait, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2, and the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of the first n odd numbers can be thought of as the total area covered by the numbers when arranged in a certain way. But that might not be helpful.

I think the two main proofs I can think of are the arithmetic series formula and mathematical induction. Both of these confirm that the sum is indeed n squared.

Let me just try to write up the proof clearly now.
</think>

To prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n², we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

1. **Identify the terms and common difference:**
   - The first n odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n - 1).
   - This is an arithmetic series with the first term \( a_1 = 1 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Apply the arithmetic series sum formula:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Here, \( a_n = 2n - 1 \), so:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (1 + (2n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2} \times (2n) = n^2
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed \( n^2 \).

This completes the proof.
