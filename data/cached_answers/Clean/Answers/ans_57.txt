Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I have this problem where I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let's see. First, what exactly are odd natural numbers? I think they are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, right? Each of these is an odd number and a natural number because they're positive integers.

So, the first n odd natural numbers would be the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., up to the nth term. For example, if n is 4, the first four odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7. Their sum should be 1 + 3 + 5 + 7, which is 16. Now, 16 is equal to 4 squared, so that works. Maybe this pattern holds for other numbers too. Let me check for n=5. The first five odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and their sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25, which is 5 squared. Hmm, seems promising.

But how do I prove this for any n? I mean, I can't just test it for specific numbers because it's supposed to work for all natural numbers. So, maybe I should use mathematical induction. I remember that induction involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step.

Let's start with the base case. If n=1, the first odd natural number is 1. So, the sum is 1, and 1 squared is also 1. That checks out. So the base case is satisfied.

Now, the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, assume that the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is k squared. So, sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k^2.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I have the formula right. The k-th odd number is 2k-1. So, if I have the first k odd numbers, their sum should be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) which equals k squared.

Now, I need to show that the sum up to the (k+1)-th odd number is (k+1)^2. So, the sum would be the previous sum plus the (k+1)-th odd number, which is 2(k+1)-1 = 2k+1. So, if I add that to the sum up to k, which is k squared, I get k squared + (2k+1).

Wait, let me calculate that: k^2 + 2k +1. Hmm, that is equal to (k + 1)^2. Yes! So, that works out. Therefore, if the statement holds for n=k, it also holds for n=k+1.

So, by mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n. That seems to make sense.

But wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using algebra or another theorem? Let me see.

I remember that the sum of an arithmetic series is given by (number of terms) multiplied by (first term plus last term) divided by 2. So, if I consider the first n odd numbers as an arithmetic sequence, then the first term a1 is 1, the common difference d is 2, and the nth term is an = 1 + (n-1)*2 = 2n-1.

So, applying the arithmetic series formula, the sum S = n*(a1 + an)/2 = n*(1 + (2n-1))/2 = n*(2n)/2 = n^2. Ah, that's another way to prove it. Nice, that's a solid proof.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. I defined a1 as 1, an as 2n-1, calculated the average as (1 + 2n-1)/2 = (2n)/2 = n, and then multiplied by n to get n squared. Yes, that makes sense. It aligns with the induction proof I did earlier.

So, I think both methods confirm that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared. That seems pretty straightforward. I guess induction was a bit more involved, but algebraically, the arithmetic series formula gives a clear path.

Alternatively, maybe I can visualize it. If I arrange numbers in certain patterns, perhaps squares, that could also demonstrate this. Let me think. If I take a square of side length n, it has n squared units. How does that relate to the sum of odd numbers?

If I construct a square by adding odd layers, like a onion, each layer being an odd number of squares, then the total number of squares would be the sum of the odd numbers. For example, a 2x2 square has 4 squares, which is 2 squared. A 3x3 square has 9 squares, which is 3 squared, and so on. So each time you increase the size by 1 in both dimensions, you're adding a new layer which is an odd number of squares. That provides another intuitive way to see why the sum equals n squared.

Hmm, that's a neat visualization. It shows the connection between geometry and the sum of numbers. Maybe that's a good way to present the proof in class.

But, stepping back, since induction and the arithmetic series formula both work, I'm confident that the proof is solid. Let me just recap:

1. Base case: n=1. Sum is 1, which is equal to 1 squared.
2. Inductive hypothesis: Assume sum up to k is k squared.
3. Inductive step: Show that sum up to k+1 is (k+1) squared, using the inductive hypothesis and adding the next term (2k+1).
4. Algebraic approach: Use the arithmetic series formula with first term 1, last term 2n-1, number of terms n, to get n squared.

Either approach works and solidifies the proof. I think I'm satisfied with this. I don't see any flaws in the logic, and the alternative approaches reinforce the same conclusion. So, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed equal to n squared.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction and the arithmetic series formula.

**Proof by Mathematical Induction:**

1. **Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
   - The first odd natural number is 1.
   - Sum = 1
   - \( 1^2 = 1 \)
   - Thus, the statement holds for \( n = 1 \).

2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**
   - Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number \( k \). That is, the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \).

3. **Inductive Step (\( n = k + 1 \)):**
   - The sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd natural numbers is:
     \[
     k^2 + (2(k + 1) - 1) = k^2 + (2k + 1)
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
     \]
   - Thus, if the statement holds for \( n = k \), it also holds for \( n = k + 1 \).

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers \( n \).

**Alternative Proof Using Arithmetic Series:**

1. **Identify the First Term (\( a \)) and Common Difference (\( d \)):**
   - First term (\( a \)) = 1
   - Common difference (\( d \)) = 2

2. **Find the \( n \)-th Term (\( a_n \)):**
   - \( a_n = a + (n - 1)d = 1 + (n - 1) \cdot 2 = 2n - 1 \)

3. **Sum of the First \( n \) Terms (\( S_n \)) using Arithmetic Series Formula:**
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a + a_n) = \frac{n}{2} (1 + (2n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2} (2n) = n^2
   \]
   - Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

**Conclusion:**

Both mathematical induction and the arithmetic series formula confirm that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
