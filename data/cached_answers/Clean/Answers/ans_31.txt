Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, for n=1, the sum is 1, which is 1 squared, that's straightforward. For n=2, it's 1+3=4, which is also 2 squared. For n=3, it's 1+3+5=9, which is 3 squared. Seems like it holds so far, but I need a general proof, not just checking examples.

Maybe I can use mathematical induction. I think that's a common method for proving statements about natural numbers. So, first, I need to show it's true for the base case, which is n=1. As we saw, 1 is 1 squared, so that's good. Now, assume it's true for some integer k, meaning the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared. Then, I need to show that the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers is (k+1) squared.

Let me write that out. The sum up to k is k squared by assumption. Then, adding the next odd number, which is the (k+1)th odd number. I remember that the nth odd number can be expressed as 2n -1. So, the (k+1)th odd number is 2(k+1) -1 = 2k +2 -1 = 2k +1.

So, according to my assumption, the sum up to k is k squared. Adding 2k +1 gives k squared + 2k +1. Wait, I recognize that as (k+1) squared because (k+1)^2 = k^2 + 2k +1. So, that works out!

Hmm, that seems to check out. Maybe induction is the way to go. I should probably state the induction hypothesis more clearly, and then proceed step by step. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series that I can use here.

The arithmetic series formula is S = n/2*(first term + last term). In this case, the first term is 1, and the last term would be the nth odd number. What's the nth odd number? I think it's 2n -1. So, plugging that in, the last term is 2n -1. So, the sum S = n/2*(1 + (2n -1)) = n/2*(2n) = n^2.

Ah, that's even simpler! So, using the arithmetic series formula directly gives me the sum as n squared. That definitely proves it without needing induction. But since the problem asked for a proof, maybe I should go back and see if induction is expected as well, since it's a standard method.

Either way, both approaches seem valid. The arithmetic series formula is quicker, but induction is a good exercise because it demonstrates a fundamental proof technique. I think I can present both methods, but maybe focus on the arithmetic series for clarity.

Alternatively, maybe I can use algebraic manipulation. I know that odd numbers can be represented as 2k -1 for k=1,2,...,n. So, the sum of the first n odd numbers is the sum from k=1 to n of (2k -1). Breaking that apart, it's 2*sum(k=1 to n)k - sum(k=1 to n)1.

The sum of k from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2, and the sum of 1 from 1 to n is just n. So, substituting in, I get 2*(n(n+1)/2) - n = n(n+1) -n = n^2 +n -n = n^2.

That also works! So, regardless of the method I choose, whether it's using induction, arithmetic series, or splitting the sum, I end up with n squared. I feel pretty confident that this proves the statement correctly.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers equals \( n^2 \), we can use the arithmetic series formula or algebraic manipulation. Here's a step-by-step explanation using the arithmetic series approach:

1. **Identify the sequence of odd numbers**: The first \( n \) odd natural numbers are \( 1, 3, 5, \ldots, (2n - 1) \).

2. **Apply the arithmetic series formula**:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
   \]
   - **First term (\( a \))**: \( 1 \)
   - **Last term (\( l \))**: \( 2n - 1 \)

3. **Substitute the values into the formula**:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (1 + (2n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2} \times (2n) = n^2
   \]

Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

\[
\boxed{n^2}
