Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can start by writing out what the first few odd numbers are and see if there's a pattern.

The first odd natural number is 1, then 3, 5, 7, and so on. If I list them out:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ...

Now, let's see what their sums are for the first few terms:

- The sum of the first 1 odd number: 1. Is this equal to 1 squared? Yes, 1 = 1².
- The sum of the first 2 odd numbers: 1 + 3 = 4. Is this equal to 2 squared? Yes, 4 = 2².
- The sum of the first 3 odd numbers: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. Is this equal to 3 squared? Yes, 9 = 3².
- The sum of the first 4 odd numbers: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. Is this equal to 4 squared? Yes, 16 = 4².

Wait a second, this seems to be a pattern. The sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared. But how do I prove this formally?

Maybe I can use mathematical induction. I remember that induction involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step.

**Base Case:** Let's check if the statement holds for n = 1.

The first odd number is 1. The sum is 1, and 1² is 1. So, it holds for n = 1.

**Inductive Step:** Assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, assume that the sum of the first k odd numbers is k².

Now, I need to show that the statement holds for k + 1. That is, the sum of the first k + 1 odd numbers should be (k + 1)².

Starting from the sum of the first k odd numbers, which is k² by the inductive hypothesis. The (k + 1)-th odd number is 2(k) + 1, which is 2k + 1. So, adding this to the sum:

Sum for k + 1 terms = k² + (2k + 1)

Simplify this expression:

k² + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)²

Which is exactly what we wanted to show. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n.

But wait, I'm supposed to provide a proof, and I used induction. Is there another way to prove this without induction? Maybe using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

An arithmetic series has a common difference between consecutive terms. Let me recall the formula:

Sum = (number of terms) × (first term + last term) / 2

In this case, the number of terms is n, the first term is 1, and the last term would be the nth odd number. What's the nth odd number?

Well, the sequence of odd numbers is 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., which can be written as 2k - 1 for k = 1, 2, 3, ..., n.

So, the nth odd number is 2n - 1.

Applying the formula:

Sum = n × (1 + (2n - 1)) / 2

Simplify inside the parentheses:

1 + 2n - 1 = 2n

So, the Sum becomes:

Sum = n × (2n) / 2 = n × n = n²

Yep, that works too. So, whether I use mathematical induction or the arithmetic series formula, I arrive at the same conclusion that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared.

I think I'm confident enough now that this proof is solid. I just need to present both methods clearly so that anyone reading it can follow along.

The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).

**Proof:**

**1. Mathematical Induction**

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
- The first odd natural number is 1.
- Sum = 1
- \( 1^2 = 1 \)
- Thus, the statement holds for \( n = 1 \).

**Inductive Step:**
- Assume that the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \). This is our induction hypothesis.

- We need to show that the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd natural numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 \).

- Starting from the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers:
  \[
  \text{Sum for } k \text{ terms} = k^2
  \]

- The next odd number after the \( k \)-th term is \( 2k + 1 \).

- Therefore, the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd numbers is:
  \[
  k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
  \]
- This completes the inductive step.

**2. Arithmetic Series Formula**

- The first \( n \) odd numbers form an arithmetic series with:
  - Number of terms (\( n \))
  - First term (\( a = 1 \))
  - Common difference (\( d = 2 \))

- The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:
  \[
  S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n - 1)d)
  \]
- Plugging in the values:
  \[
  S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 \times 1 + (n - 1) \times 2) = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 + 2n - 2) = \frac{n}{2} \times 2n = n^2
  \]
- Thus, the sum is \( n^2 \).

**Conclusion:**
Using both mathematical induction and the arithmetic series formula, we have proven that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
