Alright, let's see. I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, okay. So first off, let me understand what the problem is asking. 

An odd natural number is just any number that's not divisible by 2, right? So the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So the first n odd numbers would be 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the nth odd number. I think the question is asking me to add these up and show that it equals n squared. For example, if n is 1, the sum is 1, which is 1 squared. If n is 2, 1 + 3 is 4, which is 2 squared. If n is 3, 1 + 3 + 5 is 9, which is 3 squared. Yeah, that seems to hold up.

But how do I actually prove this? I guess I need some sort of formula or method to show that when you add up the first n odd numbers, it totals n squared. I remember that there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Let me recall that. The sum S of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by S = n/2 times (first term plus last term). So maybe I can apply that here.

Wait, let's see. An arithmetic series has a common difference between terms. In the case of odd numbers, each term increases by 2. So the common difference d is 2. The first term a is 1, as we start counting from there. So plugging into the formula, S = n/2 times (1 + (1 + 2(n - 1))). Let's simplify that. Inside the parentheses, it's 1 + (1 + 2n - 2) which simplifies to 1 + (2n - 1). So that's 2n. So the sum becomes S = n/2 times 2n. The 2n cancels out the denominator, leaving S = n squared. 

Wait, that seems straightforward. But is there a different way to think about it? Maybe using induction or some other method. I could also think about the sequence of odd numbers and how they relate to squares. I know that n squared is like a square number, and the odd numbers are spaced two apart.

Maybe another approach is to visualize the numbers or use diagrams. For example, if I take n=3, the sum is 1+3+5=9, which is 3 squared. If I can find a geometric or algebraic representation that makes this clear, that might work. Or perhaps there's a way to rearrange the numbers to show that they cover all the numbers from 1 to 2n-1, and their sum equals n squared. I'm not sure, but I think the arithmetic series formula approach is solid.

I should also test a few more cases to make sure the formula works. Let's try n=4. The sum should be 1+3+5+7=16, which is 4 squared. Using the formula: S = 4/2*(1 + (1 + 2*(4-1))) = 2*(1 + 7) = 2*8=16. Yep, that matches. How about n=5? 1+3+5+7+9=25, which is 5 squared. Applying the formula: 5/2*(1 + (1 + 2*4)) = 5/2*(1+9)=5/2*10=25. Perfect.

So, both the arithmetic series formula and the reasoning with specific examples work. I think I can safely conclude that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared, as per the arithmetic series sum formula.

The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \). Here's a step-by-step proof using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

1. **Identify the series:**
   The first \( n \) odd natural numbers form the sequence: \( 1, 3, 5, \ldots, (2n - 1) \).

2. **Determine the common difference \( d \):**
   Each term increases by 2, so the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Apply the arithmetic series sum formula:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
   \]
   Here, the first term \( a = 1 \) and the last term is \( 2n - 1 \).

4. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (1 + (2n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2} \times 2n = n^2
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is indeed \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
