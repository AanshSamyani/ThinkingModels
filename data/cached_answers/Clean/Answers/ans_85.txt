Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about this. 

First, what are the first n odd natural numbers? Well, natural numbers are just the positive integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. But odd numbers are the ones that are not divisible by 2, so they are 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So the first odd number is 1, the second is 3, the third is 5, etc.

Let me try writing down the sum for the first few n to see if it follows a pattern. 

When n = 1: The sum is just 1. And 1 squared is also 1. That works.

n = 2: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared. Okay, that checks out.

n = 3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3 squared. Nice.

n = 4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, which is 4 squared. Still works.

So the pattern seems to hold for the first few numbers. But how can I prove it in general?

I remember there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Is that applicable here? The sum of an arithmetic series is given by n times (first term plus last term) divided by 2. Let me see if I can use that.

First, let's identify the components. The first term of the odd numbers is 1. The common difference between consecutive odd numbers is 2, since each is 2 more than the previous one.

Now, the last term of the first n odd numbers. Hmm, if the first term is 1 and we have n terms, each increasing by 2, the last term should be 1 + (n-1)*2. Let's compute that: 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1. So the last term is 2n - 1.

Now, applying the arithmetic series sum formula: n * (first term + last term) / 2. Substituting, that would be n * (1 + (2n - 1)) / 2. Let me compute that inside the parentheses: 1 + 2n - 1 = 2n. So it's n * (2n) / 2. Simplifying that, n times 2n is 2n², divided by 2 is n². So that proves it!

Wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let me see: The sum is n*(first + last)/2. First is 1, last is 2n-1. 1 + 2n -1 = 2n. Then multiply by n: n*2n = 2n². Divide by 2: 2n²/2 = n². Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as induction. Let's try that.

Base case: n =1. Sum is 1, which equals 1². So base case holds.

Assume that for some k ≥1, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k². Now, what about the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers? That would be the sum of the first k odd numbers plus the (k+1)th odd number.

From the induction hypothesis, the sum of the first k is k². The (k+1)th odd number is 2(k+1) -1 = 2k + 1. So adding that, the total sum is k² + 2k +1. Wait a minute, k² + 2k +1 is (k +1)². So that's the induction step.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.

Hmm, but earlier I used the arithmetic series formula. I wonder if both approaches are valid here.

Another way could be to consider the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence. The nth term of the odd numbers is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1=1, d=2, so a_n=1 + 2(n-1)=2n-1, which matches what I found before.

So using that, the sum of n terms is n/2*(a_1 +a_n)=n/2*(1 +2n -1)=n/2*(2n)=n². Yep, same result.

I think I've covered the proof in at least two different methods: one using the arithmetic series formula, and another using mathematical induction. Both confirm that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared.

Just to double-check, I'll try n=5.

First 5 odd numbers: 1,3,5,7,9. Sum:1+3=4, +5=9, +7=16, +9=25. 25 is 5 squared. Perfect.

I think that's thorough enough. I can't think of any edge cases where this wouldn't hold, since n is a natural number and the problem specifies the first n odd natural numbers. So I feel confident with this proof.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use the properties of arithmetic series.

**Proof:**

1. **Identify the components of the arithmetic series:**
   - The first term (\( a_1 \)) is 1.
   - The common difference (\( d \)) is 2, as each odd number is 2 more than the previous one.
   - The last term (\( a_n \)) of the first \( n \) odd numbers is \( 2n - 1 \).

2. **Apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   
3. **Substitute the identified values into the formula:**
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (1 + (2n - 1))
   \]
   
4. **Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:**
   \[
   1 + (2n - 1) = 2n
   \]
   
5. **Continue simplifying:**
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times 2n = n^2
   \]
   
Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is indeed \( n^2 \).

**Verification via Mathematical Induction (Optional):**

1. **Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
   - Sum = 1
   - \( 1^2 = 1 \)
   - Statement holds.

2. **Inductive Step:**
   - Assume true for \( n = k \): Sum of first \( k \) odd numbers is \( k^2 \).
   - For \( n = k + 1 \):
     \[
     \text{Sum} = k^2 + (2(k + 1) - 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
     \]
   - Thus, the statement holds for \( k + 1 \).

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers \( n \).

**Conclusion:**

Both the arithmetic series formula and mathematical induction confirm that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \). Therefore, the statement is proven.
