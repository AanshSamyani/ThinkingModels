Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I have to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let's see. I remember that odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, where each number is two more than the previous one. 

First, maybe I should try writing out the first few odd numbers and their sums to see if I can notice a pattern. Let's take n=1, n=2, n=3, etc.

When n=1: The first odd number is just 1. So, sum = 1. That's equal to 1², which is 1. Cool, that checks out.

When n=2: The first two odd numbers are 1 and 3. Their sum is 1 + 3 = 4. And 2² is also 4. Nice, that works too.

When n=3: The first three odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. Their sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. And 3² is 9 as well. Okay, so so far it's holding up.

Wait a second, this seems like a pattern. Each time, adding the next odd number gets me a square number. So for n=k, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k². That must be true. But I need to prove it for any n, not just these examples.

Maybe I can use mathematical induction? I remember that induction involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is usually when n=1, which I've checked, and it works. Then, I assume that it works for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then I show that it must also work for k+1.

Let me try that.

Base case: n=1. The sum is 1, which is 1². So, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume that the sum of the first k odd numbers is k². That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k². Now, I need to show that the sum of the first (k+1) odd numbers is (k+1)².

What's the sum of the first (k+1) odd numbers? It's the sum of the first k odd numbers plus the next one, which is (2(k+1)-1) = 2k+1. So, Sum = k² + (2k+1).

Let me compute that: k² + 2k + 1. That's (k+1)². Perfect! So, if the assumption holds for k, then it holds for k+1 as well.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n² for all natural numbers n.

Wait, but is there another way to think about this without induction? Maybe using sequences or another formula?

I remember there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where d is the common difference. In this case, the first term a_1 is 1, and the common difference d is 2.

So, the nth odd number can be written as a_n = 1 + (n-1)*2 = 2n -1. Got it.

The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n). Plugging in the values, S_n = n/2 * (1 + (2n-1)) = n/2 * (2n) = n².

Oh, that's another way to look at it. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. So, whether I use induction or the arithmetic series formula, I end up with the same result that the sum is n².

Let me verify this with another value of n, say n=4. The first four odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7. Their sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. And 4² is 16. Perfect. So, it definitely works for n=4.

Is there any other perspective or formula that could reinforce this conclusion? Maybe looking at it graphically or using another algebraic identity?

I know that the sum of the first n odd numbers forms a square number because when you arrange them in a square pattern, each row and column has exactly n numbers. Alternatively, you can visualize each odd number as a layer adding to a square. For example, starting with a 1x1 square (sum=1), adding a 2x2 square but just one layer, which would add 3 to get 4, then adding a 3x3 square adding 5 to get 9, and so on. Each time, the added odd number forms a border around the existing square, creating the next larger square.

Hmm, that's an interesting way to think about it. Each odd number is like the perimeter of a growing square when considered in terms of grid squares. For instance, 1 is 1 square, adding 3 (which is like adding a layer around it, making a 3x3 square missing the corners) might not be the clearest way, but the key idea is that each odd number fills in a border that forms a perfect square.

Alternatively, thinking of it as a diagonal in a grid. The sum of the first n odd numbers equals the sum of the lengths of the diagonals in a square grid when you move from (0,0) to (n,n). But maybe that's complicating things unnecessarily.

I think I'm satisfied with both the induction proof and the arithmetic series formula. They both lead to the same conclusion and seem solid. I don't see any flaws in the reasoning. It all comes down to how you approach the problem—using induction for a step-by-step proof, or applying a known formula for arithmetic series which is more straightforward.

Just to recap, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared. Whether approached by induction, using the arithmetic series formula, or visualizing it geometrically, all these methods consistently show that the statement is true. Therefore, I feel confident in the result.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Base Case:**  
When \( n = 1 \), the sum is 1, which is equal to \( 1^2 \).  
Thus, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**  
Assume that the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \). That is,  
\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) = k^2 \]

We need to show that the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd natural numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 \).  
Adding the next odd number, which is \( 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1 \), to both sides:  
\[ k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2 \]

Thus, if the statement holds for \( k \), it holds for \( k + 1 \).

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers \( n \).

Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
