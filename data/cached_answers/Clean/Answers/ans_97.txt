**Proof:**

**Theorem:** The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).

**Proof:**

1. **Understanding Odd Natural Numbers:**
   
   The sequence of odd natural numbers starts from 1 and increases by 2 each time. The first \( n \) odd natural numbers are:
   \[
   1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, (2n - 1)
   \]
   
2. **Expressing the Sum:**
   
   Let \( S \) be the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers. Then:
   \[
   S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + \ldots + (2n - 1)
   \]
   
3. **Calculating the Sum:**
   
   We can observe that this sequence forms an arithmetic series where each term increases by 2. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{\text{Number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{First term} + \text{Last term})
   \]
   
   - **Number of terms:** \( n \)
   - **First term:** \( 1 \)
   - **Last term:** \( 2n - 1 \)
   
   Plugging these values into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (1 + (2n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2} \times (2n) = n \times n = n^2
   \]
   
4. **Conclusion:**
   
   Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \):
   \[
   S = n^2
   \]

This completes the proof.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
