Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, where do I start? Let me list out the first few odd numbers to see if I can spot a pattern. 

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11... Yeah, each of these can be written as 2k + 1 where k starts at 0. So, the nth term would be 2n - 1. Wait, is that right? Let me check for n=1: 2(1) - 1 = 1. For n=2: 2(2) - 1 = 3, which is correct. Okay, so the general form is correct.

Now, I need to find the sum of these terms up to n. So, S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + (2n - 1). Hmm, how do I find the sum of an arithmetic series? I remember there's a formula for that. Let me recall... Oh right, the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the number of terms multiplied by the average of the first and last term. So, S = n * (first term + last term)/2.

Applying that here, S = n * (1 + (2n - 1))/2. Let me calculate that. 1 + (2n - 1) = 2n, so then S = n * (2n)/2 = n * n = n squared. Oh, that worked out nicely! So, the sum is indeed n squared.

Wait, did I assume that it's an arithmetic series? Let me make sure. An odd natural number increases by 2 each time, so yes, it's definitely an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2. And the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series should still apply here because the difference between consecutive terms is constant. 

Alternatively, I can think about pairing the numbers. For example, take the first and last term: 1 + (2n - 1) = 2n. Similarly, take the second and second-last term: 3 + (2n - 3) = 2n. And this pattern continues all the way through. Each pair adds up to 2n, and since there are n terms, there are n/2 such pairs. So, the total sum would be n/2 * 2n = n squared. That's another way to see it without using the arithmetic series formula.

Let me try an example to verify. Let’s take n=5. The sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9. Adding these up: 1 + 3 is 4, 4 + 5 is 9, 9 + 7 is 16, 16 + 9 is 25. 5 squared is 25. It works!

Another test: n=1. Sum is 1, which is 1 squared. Good. How about n=2? Sum is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared. Yep, that's correct too.

So, I've thought about it in a couple of different ways and the results check out. This gives me confidence that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared.

The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \). Here's a step-by-step proof:

1. **Identify the sequence:**
   The sequence of odd natural numbers is \( 1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, (2n - 1) \).

2. **Apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
   \[
   S = n \times \frac{a_1 + a_n}{2}
   \]
   where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( a_n \) is the last term.

3. **Substitute the values:**
   Here, \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_n = 2n - 1 \). Plugging these into the formula:
   \[
   S = n \times \frac{1 + (2n - 1)}{2} = n \times \frac{2n}{2} = n^2
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
