Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Alright, so I have this math problem to work on: proving that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First off, what are odd natural numbers? Well, natural numbers are just the counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. Odd numbers are the ones that aren't divisible by 2, so that would be 1, 3, 5, 7, and so forth. Got it.

Now, I need to find the sum of the first n of these. So, for example, if n is 3, the first three odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, and their sum would be 1 + 3 + 5, which is 9. And 9 is 3 squared, which is 9. So that seems to check out. Let me try another one to be sure. If n is 5, the first five odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, adding those up gives 25, and that's 5 squared. Cool, that works. So, it seems like the statement is true for at least some values of n.

But how do I prove it in general? Maybe I can use a formula or some kind of induction. I remember that induction is a mathematical proof technique where you prove the base case and then show that if it's true for one case, it's true for the next.

Let me try induction then. So, first, I'll need a formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers. What's a general formula for that? Well, if I list the first few sums:

For n=1: 1 = 1² → 1=1
For n=2: 1 + 3 = 4 → 4=2²
For n=3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 → 9=3²
For n=4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 →16=4²
...

It looks like the sum is n squared. So, the formula for the sum S(n) is S(n) = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n².

Okay, so I can model S(n) as n², and I need to prove this for all natural numbers n.

But wait, perhaps I can use mathematical induction. Let me outline the steps for induction.

1. **Base Case**: Show that the statement holds true for n=1.
2. **Inductive Step**: Assume it's true for some arbitrary natural number k, meaning that S(k) = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k². Then, show that S(k+1) = (k+1)².

Starting with the base case:

For n=1, the sum is just 1, and 1 squared is 1. So, 1 = 1². That checks out.

Now, let's do the inductive step.

Assume that for n=k, S(k) = k². Now, I need to show that S(k+1) = (k+1)².

S(k+1) would be S(k) plus the next odd number after 2k-1, right? So, the next odd number is (2k-1) + 2 = 2k+1. Therefore, S(k+1) = S(k) + (2k+1).

Using the induction hypothesis, S(k) = k², so S(k+1) = k² + (2k+1).

Let me compute this:

k² + 2k + 1.

Hmm, that's equal to (k+1)², because:

(k+1)² = k² + 2k + 1.

Yes! So, S(k+1) = (k+1)².

Therefore, by mathematical induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.

Wait, but another way I can think about this is by expanding the series and using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Let me try that approach too, just to double-check.

An arithmetic series has a common difference between consecutive terms. In the case of the odd numbers, the common difference is 2, because each odd number is 2 more than the previous.

The formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (first term + last term).

In this case, the first term is 1, and the last term would be the nth odd number, which is 2n-1.

Therefore, plugging these into the formula:

S = n/2 * (1 + (2n - 1)).

Simplify the inside:

1 + 2n - 1 = 2n.

So, S = n/2 * 2n = n * n = n².

And that's exactly what we wanted to prove!

Hmm, seems like both approaches have led me to the same result. Just to be thorough, let me also consider a more visual or geometric interpretation of this problem, as sometimes visual proofs can be clearer.

Imagine laying out squares of different sizes using these odd numbers. For example, a 1x1 square uses 1 unit, a 2x2 square uses 4 units, which is 3 more than the 1x1 square. A 3x3 square adds 5 more units to get to 9, a 4x4 square adds 7 units to reach 16, and so on. So, each time you add an odd number, you're building up to a larger square. This visual representation shows how the sum of the odd numbers progresses to form squares, each with side lengths increasing by 1. Thus, the sum of the first n odd numbers creates a perfect square of size n.

That makes sense. So, both algebraic proofs and visual interpretations confirm that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed equal to n squared.

Another angle I can consider is using algebraic manipulation. Let's try to derive the sum in a more algebraic way without assuming it upfront.

We know that the sum S(n) = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1). Let me write this out:

S(n) = ∑_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1).

So, expanding that sum:

S(n) = (2*1 -1) + (2*2 -1) + (2*3 -1) + ... + (2n -1)
S(n) = (2 -1) + (4 -1) + (6 -1) + ... + (2n -1)
S(n) = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n -1)

Hmm, that just circles us back to where we started. Maybe I can pair terms in a different way to see a pattern. Let's consider writing the sum forwards and backwards.

For example, with n=4:

1 + 3 + 5 +7 = 16

If we reverse the order:

7 +5 +3 +1 = 16

Adding them together:

(1 +7) + (3 +5) =8 +8=16

Which is 4 terms multiplied by 2, so 8, and then each pair adds to 8.

Wait, but 4 terms in each direction, so that would be 8 terms in total. Wait, but the original sum was 4 terms. Hmm, I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe it's better to see the individual pairs.

Another approach is using mathematical induction, which we already did. But since I was already done with that, I might not need to revisit it here. But to further solidify my understanding, let's try induction again step by step.

So, as before:

Base Case: n=1.

Sum is 1.

Which is equal to 1²=1. So, holds true.

Inductive Step:

Assume that for some integer k ≥1, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k².

That is, S(k) =1 +3 +5 + ... + (2k-1) =k².

Now, consider the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers, S(k+1).

That would be S(k) + (2(k+1) -1).

Simplify that:

= k² + (2k +2 -1)
= k² + (2k +1)
= k² +2k +1
= (k +1)².

Therefore, if S(k) = k², then S(k+1) = (k +1)², completing the inductive step.

Hence, by mathematical induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula from number theory. For example, the sum of the first n odd numbers can be expressed as n². Is this a well-known formula? It seems familiar from the patterns we've observed. Let me verify it algebraically.

Let’s consider the general case: the sum S(n) of the first n odd numbers.

Each odd number can be written as 2k -1 for k=1 to n.

Therefore, S(n) = ∑_{k=1}^{n} (2k -1).

Calculating the sum:

= 2∑_{k=1}^{n} k - ∑_{k=1}^{n}1
= 2*(n(n +1)/2) - n
= 2*(n(n +1)/2) -n
Simplify the first term:

2*(n(n +1)/2) =n(n +1)

So, S(n)=n(n +1) -n

= n² +n -n
= n².

Yes, that gives us n squared, as required.

Alternatively, using the properties of arithmetic series. As we've already done that earlier, leading to n squared.

Hmm, so various approaches all lead back to the conclusion that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared. Thus, the proof is solid.

Wait, maybe I can also think of this as a telescoping series or see if it can be expressed in another way. Although I'm not sure if that would add more value to the proof.

Another thought: Maybe think about it in terms of geometry. If we have a square with side length n, its area is n². Now, if we can somehow relate the sum of these odd numbers to the layers or layers of squares, that might offer a deeper understanding of why it's true.

For example, starting with a 1x1 square, adding a layer around it, which is 3 units (the first odd number beyond 1). Now, the total area is 4, which is 2x2. Adding another layer, which is 5, bringing the total to 9, which is 3x3. Then another layer, adding 7, total becomes 16, which is 4x4, and so on.

So each odd number adds a layer around the square, increasing its side length by 1 each time. This layering adds 2n -1 units to the perimeter, which is the nth odd number. Hence, the sum of these layers from n=1 to n=k gives you a square of side length k.

That's quite a neat way to visualize it. So, if you imagine starting with a single point (1x1), and then each time adding an odd number, you're expanding the square outward one unit on each side. The number of units added corresponds to the side length, hence the nth odd number.

This visualization makes it clear why the sum is equal to n squared. Each addition of an odd number contributes to expanding the square, and the cumulative effect sums up to the square of the side length.

Alright, so to recap, using both algebraic methods (sum formula, pairing terms, arithmetic series), induction, and a geometric interpretation (geometric series, layering squares), it's clear that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed equal to n squared.

I think that covers it comprehensively. I've checked it from multiple angles, so I'm confident in the result.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Step 1: Base Case**

For \( n = 1 \):
\[
\text{Sum} = 1
\]
\[
1^2 = 1
\]
Thus, the statement holds for \( n = 1 \).

**Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**

Assume that the statement is true for some integer \( k \geq 1 \). That is:
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) = k^2
\]

**Step 3: Inductive Step**

We need to show that the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \). Consider the sum up to the \( (k + 1) \)-th odd number:
\[
S(k + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1)
\]
Simplify the last term:
\[
2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1
\]
So,
\[
S(k + 1) = S(k) + (2k + 1)
\]
Using the inductive hypothesis \( S(k) = k^2 \):
\[
S(k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1
\]
\[
S(k + 1) = (k + 1)^2
\]
Thus, the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \).

**Conclusion**

By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).
