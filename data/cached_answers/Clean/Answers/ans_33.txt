To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Proof by Induction:**

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
The first odd natural number is 1.
\[
1 = 1^2
\]
The base case holds true.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that the statement holds true for some integer \( k \geq 1 \); that is:
\[
\text{Sum of first } k \text{ odd natural numbers} = k^2
\]
The \( (k+1) \)-th odd natural number is \( 2k + 1 \).
Adding this to the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers:
\[
k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
\]
Thus, if the statement holds for \( k \), it also holds for \( k + 1 \).

**Conclusion:**
By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is indeed \( n^2 \).

\[
\boxed{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2i + 1) = n^2}
