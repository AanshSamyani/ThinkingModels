Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I have this math problem to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that an odd natural number can be written in the form 2k + 1, where k is a natural number. So, the first few odd numbers would be 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on.

Wait, the problem says the sum of the first n odd natural numbers. So, if I list the first few odd numbers, their sum should follow this formula. Let me test it with small values of n to see if it holds.

When n = 1: The first odd number is 1, so the sum is 1. And 1 squared is also 1. That works.

When n = 2: The first two odd numbers are 1 and 3. Their sum is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared. Good.

n = 3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, and 3 squared is 9. Still holds.

n = 4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, and 4 squared is 16. Okay, it's consistent.

So, it seems like the formula works for these cases. But how do I prove it in general?

I remember something about arithmetic series. Maybe I can use that approach. An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. In this case, the difference between consecutive odd numbers is 2. Let me check:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...
Differences: 3-1=2, 5-3=2, 7-5=2, etc. Yep, the difference is constant.

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (first term + last term). So, if I can find the first term, which is 1, and the last term, which I need to express in terms of n.

Wait, what's the last term in the sequence of the first n odd numbers? Let's denote it as L.

Since each term increases by 2, the nth term would be 1 + 2(n - 1). Let me verify:

When n = 1: 1 + 2(0) = 1 ✔️

n = 2: 1 + 2(1) = 3 ✔️

n = 3: 1 + 2(2) = 5 ✔️

n = 4: 1 + 2(3) = 7 ✔️

Looks good. So, L = 1 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 1.

So, the sum S is n/2 * (1 + (2n - 1)).

Simplifying inside the parentheses: 1 + 2n - 1 = 2n.

So, S = n/2 * 2n = n^2.

Whoa, that worked out! So, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared.

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. I used the arithmetic series formula correctly, identified the first and last terms, and substituted them. It seems consistent.

Alternatively, I think there's another way to prove this using mathematical induction. Maybe I should try that too to reinforce my understanding.

Let's try mathematical induction.

**Base Case:** n = 1.

Sum = first odd number = 1. Which is equal to 1 squared. So, base case holds.

**Inductive Step:** Assume that for some k ≥ 1, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared.

Now, consider the sum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers. This is the sum of the first k odd numbers plus the (k + 1)-th odd number.

By the inductive hypothesis, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k^2. The (k + 1)-th odd number is 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1.

So, sum = k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2.

Thus, if the statement holds for k, it holds for k + 1.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.

Okay, so both the arithmetic series approach and mathematical induction work. That gives me confidence that the sum is indeed n squared.

I wonder if there's another perspective or proof method as well. Maybe using geometry?

Hmm, if I think of the sum of odd numbers as layers of squares, each layer adding a ring around a central square.

For example:

n = 1: 1

n = 2: 1 + 3 = 4

n = 3: 4 + 5 = 9

n = 4: 9 + 7 = 16

And so on.

It seems like each odd number adds a new layer that completes the square. So, the total after n layers is n squared. That also makes sense.

Maybe using visual representation: imagine each odd number as a square frame. So, 1 is just a single dot. Adding 3 would make a 2x2 square, adding 5 makes a 3x3, and so on. Hence, after n such frames, you end up with an n x n square.

That's an interesting geometric interpretation as well. It reinforces the algebraic proof.

I think I'm confident now that the sum of the first n odd numbers is indeed n squared. Both the arithmetic series formula and mathematical induction solidify this, and the geometric interpretation provides an intuitive understanding.

I should summarize my thoughts:

1. Identified that odd numbers can be expressed as 2k + 1.
2. Calculated the sum using the arithmetic series formula, arriving at n^2.
3. Verified with mathematical induction.
4. Considered a geometric interpretation.
5. All methods consistently lead to the conclusion that the sum is n squared.

Hence, the proof is complete.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can follow these steps:

**Step 1: Express the first \( n \) odd numbers**

The first \( n \) odd natural numbers are:
\[ 1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, (2n - 1) \]

**Step 2: Use the Arithmetic Series Sum Formula**

The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term}) \]

Here, the first term \( a = 1 \), and the last term \( l = 2n - 1 \).

**Step 3: Calculate the Sum**

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ S = \frac{n}{2} \times (1 + (2n - 1)) \]
\[ S = \frac{n}{2} \times (2n) \]
\[ S = n^2 \]

**Step 4: Verification via Mathematical Induction**

*Base Case:*

For \( n = 1 \):
\[ \text{Sum} = 1 = 1^2 \]
Base case holds.

*Inductive Step:*

Assume that for some integer \( k \geq 1 \), the sum of the first \( k \) odd numbers is \( k^2 \).

We need to show that the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 \).

Consider the sum:
\[ S_{k+1} = S_k + (2(k + 1) - 1) \]
\[ S_{k+1} = k^2 + (2k + 1) \]
\[ S_{k+1} = k^2 + 2k + 1 \]
\[ S_{k+1} = (k + 1)^2 \]

Thus, if the statement holds for \( k \), it holds for \( k + 1 \).

By mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers \( n \).

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).
