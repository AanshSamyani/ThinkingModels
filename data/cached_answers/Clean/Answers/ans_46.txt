Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I have to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

First, what is an odd natural number? Well, natural numbers are the counting numbers like 1, 2, 3, and so on. Odd numbers among them would be 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., right? So the sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., up to the nth term.

Now, the problem is asking for the sum of the first n odd numbers and whether that sum equals n squared. So, for example, if n is 1, then the sum is 1, which is 1 squared. If n is 2, the sum is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared. Let me check a few more to see if the pattern holds.

For n = 3, the numbers are 1, 3, 5, summing up to 9, which is 3 squared. Okay, this seems to hold. So maybe there's a formula that generalizes this.

Let me try to write the first few sums:

- Sum of first 1 odd: 1 = 1²
- Sum of first 2 odds: 1 + 3 = 4 = 2²
- Sum of first 3 odds: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3²
- Sum of first 4 odds: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 4²

Yeah, that seems consistent. So, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n². But I need to prove this for any n. How can I do that?

I remember that there's a formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers. Let me recall it. The kth odd number is (2k - 1), right? So the sum would be the sum from k = 1 to n of (2k - 1). Maybe I can write that as:

Sum = Σ (2k - 1) from k=1 to n

I can split this into two separate sums:

Sum = Σ 2k - Σ 1 from k=1 to n

Which is:

Sum = 2 Σ k - Σ 1

Now, Σ k from 1 to n is n(n + 1)/2, and Σ 1 from 1 to n is just n, since you're adding 1 n times.

Substituting these in:

Sum = 2 [n(n + 1)/2] - n

Simplify this:

The 2 and the denominator 2 cancel out, so we have:

Sum = n(n + 1) - n

Which simplifies further:

n(n + 1) = n² + n, so subtracting n gives:

Sum = n² + n - n = n²

So, the sum is indeed n squared.

Wait a minute, let me double-check. If I use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, the sum of the first n terms is (number of terms)/2 multiplied by (first term + last term). 

Here, the number of terms is n. The first term is 1, and the last term should be 2n - 1. Let's check for n=4: 2*4 -1=7, yes that's correct.

So, plugging into the arithmetic series formula:

Sum = n/2 * (1 + (2n - 1)) = n/2 * (2n) = n * n = n²

So that confirms it another way.

Alternatively, I can think of pairing terms. For example, in the sum 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1). If I write them as:

1 = 1

3 = 1 + 2

5 = 3 + 2

7 = 5 + 2

...

(2n - 1) = (2n - 3) + 2

So, adding all of them up, each term except the last one contributes a 2. How many 2s are there? There are (n - 1) terms contributing a 2. And then the first term is 1.

So total sum is 1 + 2(n - 1) = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n -1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when n=1, 2(1) -1=1, which is correct. When n=2, 2(2) -1=3, but sum is 1+3=4, which is not equal. Wait, that doesn't add up.

Maybe I made a mistake in the pairing. Let me try again. How many 2s do I have? Each of the n terms (excluding 1) is preceded by a 2, so there are n-1 2s. So total sum is 1 + 2(n-1) + 1? Wait, that's inconsistent. Let me correct.

Each term beyond the first can be expressed as (previous term) + 2. So, each term beyond the first contributes an additional 2. But since the first term is 1, which doesn't have a preceding term, the total would be 1 + 2*(n -1). 

Wait, when n=1, it gives 1 + 2*(0) =1, which is correct. For n=2, 1 + 2*(1)=3, but the actual sum is 4, which is 3 +1. Hmm, not quite right.

Alternatively, maybe each term after the first contributes a 2, and since there are n terms, the sum becomes 1 + 2*(n - 1) + 1. Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, consider that in the sum, each odd number can be represented as 2m -1, where m ranges from 1 to n. So, sum is Σ (2m -1) = 2 Σ m - Σ 1. Which is 2*(n(n +1)/2) -n= n(n +1) -n =n². That's a better way.

Either way, whether using arithmetic series or splitting the sum into two parts, I get the same result. Thus, the sum of the first n odd numbers is indeed n squared.

So, summarizing the proof:

1. Express the sum as Σ (2k - 1) from k=1 to n.
2. Split into Σ 2k - Σ 1.
3. Compute each sum separately:
   - Σ 2k = 2*(n(n +1)/2) =n(n +1)
   - Σ 1 from 1 to n =n
4. Subtract to get n(n +1) -n =n².

Hence, proven.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Express the sum using the formula for the \( k \)-th odd number:**
   The \( k \)-th odd number is \( 2k - 1 \). Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers can be written as:
   \[
   S = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)
   \]

2. **Split the sum into two separate sums:**
   \[
   S = \sum_{k=1}^{n} 2k - \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1
   \]

3. **Compute each part of the sum:**
   - The first sum is twice the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{n} 2k = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = 2 \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right) = n(n + 1)
     \]
   - The second sum is simply adding 1 \( n \) times:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 = n
     \]

4. **Combine the results:**
   \[
   S = n(n + 1) - n = n^2 + n - n = n^2
   \]

Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).
