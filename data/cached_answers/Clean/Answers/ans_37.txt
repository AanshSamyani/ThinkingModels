Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.

Alright, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, let me make sure I understand what's being asked. The first n odd natural numbers would be numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, up to the nth odd number. So if n is 1, the sum is just 1. If n is 2, it's 1 + 3 = 4. If n is 3, it's 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, and so on. I notice that the results are perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. So I need to show that this pattern holds true for any positive integer n.

Okay, so maybe I can start by writing out the general form of the nth odd number. I know that odd numbers can be expressed as 2k - 1, where k is a positive integer. Let's test this with some numbers. If k = 1, 2(1) - 1 = 1. If k = 2, 2(2) - 1 = 3. Perfect! So the nth odd number is 2n - 1.

Now, if I want to find the sum of the first n odd numbers, I can represent this sum mathematically as:

S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + (2n - 1)

Okay, I need to find a way to express this sum so that I can simplify it and show it equals n squared. I remember something about arithmetic series, maybe this can be applied here. An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers with a constant difference between consecutive terms. In this case, the common difference is 2 because each odd number is 2 more than the previous one.

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:

S = (number of terms) × (first term + last term) / 2

Let me apply this formula to our problem. The number of terms is n, the first term is 1, and the last term is (2n - 1). Plugging these into the formula gives:

S = n × (1 + (2n - 1)) / 2

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

1 + (2n - 1) = 1 + 2n - 1 = 2n

So, the formula becomes:

S = n × (2n) / 2

Simplify further:

(2n) / 2 = n

So, now we have:

S = n × n = n^2

Which is what we wanted to prove: the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared.

Wait a minute, let me double-check this logic because sometimes when I rush through proofs, I might skip a step or make a mistake. Let me go through each part again.

First, identifying the nth odd number as 2n - 1 is correct because it follows the arithmetic progression with the first term 1 and common difference 2. 

Then, applying the arithmetic series sum formula. Number of terms is indeed n. First term is 1, last term is 2n - 1. Adding those gives 2n, and multiplying by the number of terms and dividing by 2 gives n^2.

Another way to think about it is through induction. Maybe I should try mathematical induction as an alternative method to confirm the result.

Base case: n = 1

Sum = 1, which is 1^2. So it holds.

Inductive step: Assume that for some integer k, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k^2. Now, let's consider the sum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers, which would be k^2 + (2k + 1).

Simplify that:

k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2

Which is what we wanted to show. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.

Hmm, so both the arithmetic series approach and induction seem to confirm that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared. I feel pretty confident about this now.
</think>

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use two methods: an arithmetic series formula approach and mathematical induction.

**Arithmetic Series Approach:**

1. **Identify the nth odd number:** 
   The \( n \)-th odd number is given by \( 2n - 1 \).

2. **Sum the first \( n \) odd numbers:**
   \[
   S = 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n - 1)
   \]

3. **Apply the arithmetic series sum formula:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (1 + (2n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2} \times 2n = n^2
   \]

**Mathematical Induction:**

1. **Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 = 1^2
   \]
   The statement holds.

2. **Inductive Step:**
   Assume the statement holds for \( n = k \), i.e.,
   \[
   1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) = k^2
   \]
   For \( n = k + 1 \):
   \[
   \text{Sum} = k^2 + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)^2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   k^2 + 2k + 1 = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
   \]
   Thus, the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \).

By mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \( n \).

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).
