Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let's start by writing down what those numbers look like. The first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. Each one increases by 2 from the previous.

If I want to add the first n of these, I can denote each term as 2k - 1, where k starts at 1 and goes up to n. So the sum S would be:

S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + (2n - 1)

I need to show that this sum equals n². Maybe I can use some kind of pattern or formula to help me. Let me try calculating it for small values of n to see if I can spot a pattern.

When n = 1:
S = 1
1² = 1
So, 1 = 1. That works.

When n = 2:
S = 1 + 3 = 4
2² = 4
Okay, that's good.

When n = 3:
S = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
3² = 9
Still matches.

When n = 4:
S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
4² = 16
Awesome, works again.

This is reassuring. Now, how can I generalize this? Maybe I can use mathematical induction or some known formula.

Wait, I remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:

Sum = (number of terms) × (first term + last term) / 2

Let me apply that here. The number of terms is n, the first term is 1, and the last term is 2n - 1. Plugging those into the formula:

Sum = n × (1 + (2n - 1)) / 2
Simplify inside the parentheses:
1 + 2n - 1 = 2n
So, Sum = n × 2n / 2
Simplify:
n × 2n / 2 = n × n = n²

Oh, that's a neat proof! But wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe pairing the numbers somehow. Let me try pairing the first and last term, second and second-last term, etc.

For n = 3:
1 + 3 + 5
Pair 1 and 5: 1 + 5 = 6
Then add the middle term 3: 6 + 3 = 9

For n = 4:
1 + 3 + 5 + 7
Pair 1 and 7: 1 + 7 = 8
Pair 3 and 5: 3 + 5 = 8
Total Sum: 8 + 8 = 16

I notice that each pair adds up to 2n. For n = 3, each pair was 6 = 2×3. For n = 4, each pair was 8 = 2×4. That seems consistent. So, the total sum would be the number of pairs times 2n.

Number of pairs is n/2, but for n even, that works. For n odd, like 3, you have a middle term that's not paired. So, to generalize:

Total Sum = (Number of Pairs) × 2n

If n is even:
Number of pairs = n/2
Total Sum = (n/2) × 2n = n × n = n²

If n is odd:
Number of pairs = (n - 1)/2
Middle term is n itself (since 2×(n) -1 = 2n -1, which is the last term for n=3)
So, Total Sum = [(n - 1)/2] × 2n + n = (n - 1) × n + n = n² - n + n = n²

Either way, whether n is odd or even, the total sum equals n squared.

Wait, I'm not sure if using pairs is the best approach here, but it does seem to work. Another idea is to use mathematical induction. Let me try that.

Base case: n = 1
Sum = 1
1² = 1
True.

Inductive step: Assume it's true for n = k, that Sum = k². Then, for n = k +1, the sum should be k² + (2k +1).

But wait, when I add the next odd number, which is 2(k +1) -1 = 2k +1. So, Sum = k² + 2k +1 = (k +1)²

Yes, that works. So, by induction, it's true for all positive integers n.

So, there are multiple ways to approach this proof: using the arithmetic series formula, pairing the terms, or mathematical induction.

I think I've got enough to write up the proof clearly.

To prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n², we can use mathematical induction and another algebraic method.

**Proof Using Mathematical Induction:**

*Statement:* The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n².

*Base Case (n = 1):*
The first odd number is 1.
Sum = 1
n² = 1² = 1
Thus, the base case holds.

*Inductive Step:*
Assume the statement is true for some positive integer k, i.e.,
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k²

We need to show that the statement holds for k + 1:
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)²

Starting from the left side:
Sum = k² + (2k + 1)
Sum = k² + 2k + 1
Sum = (k² + 2k + 1)
Sum = (k + 1)²

Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n.

**Alternative Proof Using Arithmetic Series:**

The first n odd natural numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term (a₁) is 1, the last term (a_n) is (2n - 1), and the common difference (d) is 2.

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:
S = n × (a₁ + a_n) / 2

Substituting the values:
S = n × [1 + (2n - 1)] / 2
Simplify inside the brackets:
1 + 2n - 1 = 2n
Thus:
S = n × 2n / 2
S = n × n
S = n²

Therefore, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n².<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
