Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to figure out why the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me start by writing down what the first few odd numbers look like. 

The first odd natural number is 1, right? Then the next one is 3, followed by 5, and so on. So the sequence goes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. If I take the first n of these numbers, their sum should be n squared. Let me check this for small values of n to see if it holds.

For example, when n is 1: the sum is 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So it works here.

What about n equals 2? The first two odd numbers are 1 and 3. Their sum is 1 + 3, which is 4. And 2 squared is 4. So it works for n equals 2 as well.

Moving on to n equals 3. The first three odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. Their sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. And 3 squared is 9. So that's still matching.

Let me try n equals 4. The first four odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7. Adding them up: 1 + 3 is 4, plus 5 is 9, plus 7 is 16. 4 squared is 16. Okay, that works too.

Wait a second, I'm noticing a pattern here. When I add up the first n odd numbers, the result is n squared. So it seems to be a true statement, at least for these small numbers. But of course, that doesn't mean it's always true—it just means that it works for the cases I checked.

Now, to actually prove this in general, I need a more formal approach. Maybe I can use mathematical induction? That sounds like a good idea because it's a common method for proving statements that involve natural numbers.

Alright, so mathematical induction consists of two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let's start with the base case. 

Base Case: Let me take n equals 1. As I saw earlier, the first odd number is 1, and 1 squared is also 1. So the base case holds true.

Inductive Step: Now, I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, assume that the sum of the first k odd numbers is equal to k squared. 

Let me write that down. 

Sum of first k odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k².

Wait, actually, the nth odd number can be represented as 2n - 1. So if I substitute that in, the sum would be:

Sum from i = 1 to k of (2i - 1) = k².

Okay, now I need to prove that this sum is indeed k squared, given that the sum of the first k-1 odd numbers is (k-1)².

So, let's try to express the sum of the first k odd numbers in terms of the sum of the first k-1 odd numbers. That is:

Sum from i = 1 to k of (2i - 1) = (Sum from i = 1 to k-1 of (2i - 1)) + (2k - 1).

By the induction hypothesis, the sum up to k-1 is (k-1)². So plugging that in, we get:

(k-1)² + (2k - 1).

Now, let's expand (k-1)². That equals k² - 2k + 1. So now, adding (2k -1) to that:

(k² - 2k + 1) + (2k - 1) = k² - 2k + 1 + 2k -1.

Simplify that: The -2k and +2k cancel each other out, and 1 - 1 also cancels. So we're left with k².

Wow, so the inductive step works because when you add the kth odd number to the sum of the first k-1 numbers, it equals k squared. So the induction holds for k. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.

Wait a minute, did I make an error there? Let me go through the inductive step again to be sure. 

Assume that the sum up to k-1 is (k-1)². Then, the sum up to k is the sum up to k-1 plus the kth odd number, which is (2k -1). 

So, (k-1)² + (2k -1). Let me compute that:

(k-1)² = k² - 2k + 1.

Adding 2k - 1:

k² - 2k + 1 + 2k -1 = k².

Yep, that's correct. So the inductive step works out. 

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. 

The odd numbers form an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. The first term is 1, the last term of the first k terms is 2k - 1, and there are k terms in total. 

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms) times (first term plus last term) divided by 2. So that's:

S = k * (1 + (2k - 1)) / 2.

Simplify inside the parentheses: 1 + 2k -1 = 2k.

So, S = k * (2k) / 2 = k * k = k².

That's a pretty straightforward way to look at it too. So regardless of the approach—either induction or the arithmetic series formula—it leads us to the same result.

I guess another angle to consider is the pairing of numbers. If I pair the first and last numbers, the second and second last, and so on, each pair sums to the same value. For example, 1 + (2k -1) = 2k, 3 + (2k -3) = 2k, and so on. How many such pairs are there?

Since there are k terms, there are k/2 pairs, but only if k is even. If k is odd, there's an unpaired middle number which is k itself. Wait, let's test this.

Take n=3: terms are 1,3,5. Pairing them: (1+5)=6, and 3 is left alone. So the sum is 6 + 3 = 9. Each pair sums to 6, which is 2k where k=3 (6=2*3). Hmm, no, actually, 6 is 2*(3). Wait, is that consistent?

Wait, hold on. In the case of k=3: each pair sums to 6, which is 2*3. Then, adding the unpaired 3 would give 6 + 3 = 9, which is 3 squared. So maybe it's a similar idea.

But for larger k, let's say k=4: 1,3,5,7. Pairing: (1+7)=8, (3+5)=8. Two pairs of 8, so 8 + 8 = 16, which is 4 squared.

Wait a second, each pair in this way sums to 2k. So in the case where k is even, each pair sums to 2k. For the first pair: 1 + (2k-1) = 2k, second pair: 3 + (2k-3) = 2k, etc. So each of the k/2 pairs sums to 2k. Then the total sum would be (k/2)*2k = k squared. That seems to make sense.

But what happens if k is odd? Let's say k=5: 1,3,5,7,9. Pairing: (1+9)=10, (3+7)=10, and the middle term is 5. So two pairs of 10, and the middle term 5. The sum is 10 +10 +5=25=5 squared.

Each pair sums to 10, which is 2k when k=5 (since 2*5=10). The middle term is also k. So in this case, the sum is 2*(number of pairs)*k + middle term? Wait, in the case of k=5, the number of pairs is 2, each summing to 10, and then adding the middle term 5. So 2*10 +5=25. But 2*10 is 20, plus 5 is 25, which is 5 squared. That seems correct.

Wait, so whether k is even or odd, the formula holds? Let me test it for k=1. For k=1, pair: (1)=1, and the middle term is 1. So it's just 1*1=1. Correct.

For k=2, it's 1,3. Pairs: (1+3)=4. So total sum is 4, which is 2 squared. Correct.

So the general formula holds for k odd or even. Each pair sums to 2k, and there are (k-1)/2 pairs for odd k (since the middle term isn't paired) and k/2 pairs for even k. Then, adding the middle term when k is odd. But in both cases, the total sum is k squared.

Therefore, whether using induction, the arithmetic series formula, or the pairing method, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is always n squared. 

Is there any other perspective or method to confirm this? Maybe using mathematical induction with a different base case. 

Wait, I already did the base case for n=1 and for n=2. What about n=0? The sum of zero odd numbers would be zero, which is 0 squared. So that holds too.

But n starts from 1, I guess. So that's fine.

Alternatively, I can think of this as the sum of an infinite series but limited to n terms. As n increases, the sum approaches infinity, but this is for finite n.

Another thought: The difference between consecutive squares is an odd number. For example:

(1)^2 = 1

(2)^2 = 4. The difference is 3, which is the second odd number.

(3)^2 = 9. The difference is 5, the third odd number.

(4)^2 =16. The difference is7, the fourth odd number.

And so on. So the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared because each odd number added to the previous sum gives the next square.

So, starting at 1 and adding 2k-1 each time gives n squared.

That seems a bit hand-wavy, but it makes sense because each addition of the next odd number increases the sum by an odd number, leading to a perfect square progression.

Alternatively, thinking of it as the sum of the first n natural numbers, but in a different fashion.

Wait, the sum of natural numbers formula is n(n+1)/2. But in this case, the sum of odd numbers is n squared. So, different formulas, but the relationship is established by their sums.

But let me get back to induction. I think I've covered several methods—induction, the arithmetic series, pairing—all showing that the sum of the first n odd numbers is indeed n squared. I think I have solidified my understanding through multiple approaches, and each one supports the conclusion.

I suppose the key takeaway is that each odd number can be represented as 2k-1, and when summed, they form a perfect square sequence. It's a beautiful example of how mathematical patterns emerge and how different concepts from sequences, series, and number theory interconnect.

Just to make sure, let me recast the problem in summation notation:

Sum from k=1 to n of (2k -1) = n².

Yes, that's correct. Each term is odd, so 2k-1, and we sum n terms of that. The result is n squared.

All right, I think I'm confident enough that this statement is true and that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared.

The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed equal to \( n^2 \). We can prove this using mathematical induction.

**Base Case:**
For \( n = 1 \):
The first odd number is 1.
Sum = 1 = \( 1^2 = 1 \).
Thus, the statement holds for \( n = 1 \).

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary natural number \( k \); that is:
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k - 1) = k^2
\]
We need to show that:
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2
\]
Starting with the left side:
\[
k^2 + (2(k+1) - 1) = k^2 + (2k + 2 - 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1
\]
Simplify:
\[
k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
\]
Thus, the statement holds for \( k + 1 \).

By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed \( n^2 \).
