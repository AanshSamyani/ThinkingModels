To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can proceed as follows:

**Step 1: Define the sequence of odd natural numbers.**

The first \( n \) odd natural numbers are:
\[
1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, (2n - 1)
\]

**Step 2: Write the sum of these numbers.**

Let \( S \) denote the sum:
\[
S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + \ldots + (2n - 1)
\]

**Step 3: Pair the terms for simplification.**

Observe that by pairing the first and last terms:
\[
1 + (2n - 1) = 2n \\
3 + (2n - 3) = 2n \\
5 + (2n - 5) = 2n \\
\vdots \\
\]
The middle term, if \( n \) is odd, does not occur, but for even \( n \), all terms pair up.

**Step 4: Calculate the sum using the paired terms.**

Each pair sums to \( 2n \), and there are \( n \) such pairs:
\[
S = n \times 2n = 2n^2
\]

Wait a minute. This result suggests that the sum is \( 2n^2 \), not \( n^2 \). This contradicts our initial assertion. Let's review our steps.

**Step 5: Identify the error in reasoning.**

Upon closer inspection, we realize that the correct pairing actually leads to:
\[
S = n \times n = n^2
\]
**Step 6: Correct the calculation.**

Upon closer examination, the correct number of pairs is indeed \( n \), but each pair sums to \( 2n \). Thus:
\[
S = n \times 2n = 2n^2
\]
This suggests that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( 2n^2 \), not \( n^2 \).

**Step 7: Realize the error in the original assertion.**

The original statement that the sum is \( n^2 \) is incorrect. The correct sum is \( 2n^2 \).

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is actually \( 2n^2 \), not \( n^2 \).

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( 2n^2 \), not \( n^2 \). Therefore, the original assertion is incorrect.
