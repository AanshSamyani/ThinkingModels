Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the odd natural numbers are. They are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, the first n odd numbers would be 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the nth odd number. 

I think the best way to approach this is by trying to find a pattern or formula that can express the sum of these numbers. Let me list out the sums for small values of n to see if I can notice any pattern.

For n = 1: The first odd natural number is 1. So, sum = 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, 1 = 1². That works.

For n = 2: The first two odd numbers are 1 and 3. Their sum is 1 + 3 = 4. And 2 squared is 4. So, 4 = 4. Still holds.

For n = 3: The first three odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. Their sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. And 3 squared is 9. So, 9 = 9. Still consistent.

For n = 4: The first four odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, and 7. Their sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. And 4 squared is 16. So, 16 = 16. Perfect.

Okay, so empirically, it seems to hold for n = 1, 2, 3, 4. But how do I prove it for any n?

I remember there's a formula for the sum of the first n odd natural numbers. Let me recall what that is. Oh yeah, it's n squared. So, I don't have to derive it from scratch, but perhaps it's useful to know. But for the proof, maybe I can consider writing out the sum and see how it adds up.

Let me denote S as the sum of the first n odd natural numbers. So,

S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + (2n - 1)

I know that each term is of the form (2k - 1) where k goes from 1 to n. So, S can be expressed as the sum from k = 1 to n of (2k - 1).

So,

S = Σ (2k - 1) from k=1 to n

I can split this sum into two separate sums:

S = Σ 2k from k=1 to n - Σ 1 from k=1 to n

Let me compute each of these.

First, Σ 2k from k=1 to n is equal to 2 * Σ k from k=1 to n.

We know that Σ k from k=1 to n is n(n + 1)/2. So,

Σ 2k = 2 * [n(n + 1)/2] = n(n + 1)

Next, Σ 1 from k=1 to n is just adding 1 n times, which equals n.

So, putting it all together:

S = n(n + 1) - n = n(n + 1 - 1) = n * n = n²

So, that shows that S = n². Therefore, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed equal to n squared.

Wait, but let me verify this for n=5 to make sure.

For n=5: The first five odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Their sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25. 5 squared is 25. So, it holds here as well.

Hmm, but maybe I should think of another way to approach this problem, just to solidify my understanding. Perhaps using induction?

I recall that mathematical induction is a method to prove statements for all natural numbers. So, let me try to apply induction here.

First, base case: n = 1. We've already checked that S = 1, which is equal to 1². So, the base case holds.

Now, assume that the statement holds for some integer k, that is, the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is k².

So, we can write:

1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k²

Now, let's consider the sum for n = k + 1. The sum would be:

1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1)

But by the induction hypothesis, we know the first k terms sum to k². So,

Sum = k² + [2(k + 1) - 1] = k² + [2k + 2 - 1] = k² + (2k + 1)

Now, let's compute this:

Sum = k² + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)²

Which is exactly what we wanted to show. So, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.

Wait, that seems a bit longer, but okay. So, in summary, both the direct computation and mathematical induction show that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared. Therefore, the statement is proven.
</think>

Now, let's provide a clear step-by-step proof.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The first n odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the nth term, which can be expressed as (2n - 1).

2. **Express the Sum:**
   Let S denote the sum of these n terms:
   \[
   S = 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n - 1)
   \]

3. **Use the Formula for Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{(\text{First Term} + \text{Last Term}) \times \text{Number of Terms}}{2}
   \]
   Here, the first term is 1, the last term is (2n - 1), and the number of terms is n.

4. **Plug In the Values:**
   \[
   S = \frac{(1 + (2n - 1)) \times n}{2} = \frac{(2n) \times n}{2} = \frac{2n^2}{2} = n^2
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

**Verification with Examples:**

- **For n = 1:**
  Sum = 1 = \( 1^2 \)

- **For n = 2:**
  Sum = 1 + 3 = 4 = \( 2^2 \)

- **For n = 3:**
  Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = \( 3^2 \)

- **For n = 4:**
  Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = \( 4^2 \)

- **For n = 5:**
  Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 = \( 5^2 \)

**Mathematical Induction Proof:**

1. **Base Case (n = 1):**
   \[
   S = 1 = 1^2
   \]
   The base case holds.

2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**
   Assume that for some integer \( k \geq 1 \), the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \).

3. **Inductive Step:**
   Consider the sum for \( n = k + 1 \):
   \[
   S_{k+1} = S_k + (2(k + 1) - 1) = k^2 + (2k + 1)
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   S_{k+1} = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
   \]
   Thus, if the statement holds for n = k, it also holds for n = k + 1.

4. **Conclusion:**
   By mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n.

Hence, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
