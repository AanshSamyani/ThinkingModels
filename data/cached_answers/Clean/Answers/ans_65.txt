Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I'm trying to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let's see. I remember that natural numbers are just the counting numbers like 1, 2, 3, and so on. So, the first few odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. So, the sum of these numbers up to the nth one should be n².

Let me write them out for the first few n to see if there's a pattern.

For n=1: sum = 1 → 1² = 1, so that's equal.

For n=2: sum = 1+3=4 → 2²=4, also equal.

For n=3: sum = 1+3+5=9 → 3²=9, same result.

n=4: 1+3+5+7=16 → 4²=16, still matching.

So, empirically, the formula seems to hold for the first few cases. But how do I prove it for all n?

I've heard about mathematical induction before. Maybe that's the way to go. Let me recall how induction works. To prove something is true for all natural numbers n, you show that it's true for the base case, and then show that if it's true for any arbitrary case n=k, then it must also be true for n=k+1.

So, base case. Let's take n=1. The sum of the first 1 odd number is 1, which is equal to 1². So, base case holds.

Now, assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k, meaning that the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is k². I need to show that then the sum of the first k+1 odd natural numbers is (k+1)².

Let's compute the sum up to k+1:

Sum for k+1 = Sum for k + (k+1)th odd number.

From the induction hypothesis, the sum for k is k². So, I need to find what the (k+1)th odd number is.

I recall that odd numbers can be represented as 2m - 1, where m starts at 1. So, the first odd number is 1 (m=1), second is 3 (m=2), third is 5 (m=3), and so on. So, the mth odd number is 2m -1.

So, the (k+1)th odd number would be 2*(k+1) -1 = 2k +2 -1 = 2k+1.

Therefore, Sum for k+1 = k² + (2k+1) = k² + 2k +1.

Hmm, that simplifies to (k +1)², right? Let's check:

(k +1)² = k² + 2k +1.

Yes, exactly what I have.

So, if the statement holds for k, it holds for k+1.

Since the base case holds, by induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I should try another approach to confirm.

Another way I heard about is using mathematical induction with the assumption of the sum equals n² and trying to verify that the next term fits the pattern.

Let me see.

Assume that the sum up to n is n². Now, the next odd number is 2n+1 (since the nth odd number is 2n -1, so the next one would be 2n+1, but wait, that's not right. Wait, if the nth odd number is 2n-1, then the (n+1)th odd number is 2n+1? Let me confirm.

Wait, first odd number is 1=2*1-1, second is 3=2*2-1, third is 5=2*3-1. So, nth is 2n-1, then (n+1)th is 2(n+1)-1 = 2n+2 -1 = 2n+1. So yes, each odd number is 2n+1 for the next term.

Therefore, the sum up to (n+1) terms is sum up to n terms plus (2n+1). So, that would be n² + (2n+1) = n² + 2n +1 = (n+1)². That also makes sense.

Hmm, so both approaches give the same result. Let me also think about another way.

Maybe I can use the formula for the sum of arithmetic series. I remember that an arithmetic series has a first term a, a common difference d, and n terms. The sum S is given by S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d).

In this case, our series is the sum of the first n odd natural numbers.

Let's figure out what a and d are.

The first term a =1.

What's the common difference d?

The difference between consecutive odd numbers is 2. For example, 3-1=2, 5-3=2, etc. So, d=2.

So, the sum S = n/2 * [2*1 + (n-1)*2] = n/2 * [2 + 2n - 2] = n/2 * (2n) = n *n =n².

There we go, that directly gives the formula without needing induction.

Wow, okay. That's even easier. So, for any arithmetic series where a=1 and d=2, the sum is n².

Alternatively, if I didn't remember that formula, but wanted to derive it, maybe I can write it out.

So, the arithmetic series sum formula is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d].

Given a=1, d=2.

Plugging in, S = n/2 * [2*1 + (n-1)*2] = n/2 * [2 + 2n - 2] = n/2 * 2n = n *n = n².

Yes, that confirms it again.

Wait, maybe I should think of another perspective.

I can consider the fact that odd numbers are consecutive integers from 1 to 2n-1 if I take n odd numbers. Wait, no, that's not right. For example, taking the first 3 odd numbers:1,3,5. Their sum is 9, which is 3². But 1,3,5 are three numbers, and their sum is 9.

Wait, but 1+3+5+...+(2k-1) = k².

Wait, maybe that's another way to see it. The sum of the first k odd natural numbers is k².

But then, in the original problem, it's just n odd numbers, so sum is n².

So, that's similar to the concept.

Alternatively, if I think of writing out the numbers and pairing them up.

For example, 1 and (n odd number) adding to (2n-1), the next two odds adding to (2n+1), etc., but that might complicate.

Wait, no, in the arithmetic series approach, we saw that it simplifies directly to n².

I think that's sufficient for now. So, whether through induction, direct formula, or arithmetic series sum formula, all approaches point to the sum being n².

Therefore, the proof is established.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use multiple approaches, including mathematical induction, the arithmetic series formula, and direct summation.

**Proof:**

**1. Using the Arithmetic Series Formula**

An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the preceding term. The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} [2a + (n - 1)d]
\]

where:
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( d \) is the common difference.

For the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers:
- The first term \( a = 1 \),
- The common difference \( d = 2 \).

Plugging these into the formula:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} [2(1) + (n - 1)(2)] \\
S = \frac{n}{2} [2 + 2n - 2] \\
S = \frac{n}{2} (2n) \\
S = n \times n \\
S = n^2
\]

Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

**2. Mathematical Induction**

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**

The first odd natural number is 1. The sum for \( n = 1 \) is:

\[
1 = 1^2 = 1
\]

The base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**

Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number \( k \), i.e., the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \).

We need to show that the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd natural numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 \).

Consider the sum up to \( k + 1 \):

\[
\text{Sum} = \text{Sum up to } k + (k + 1) \text{th odd number}
\]

From the inductive hypothesis, the sum up to \( k \) is \( k^2 \). The \( (k + 1) \)th odd number is:

\[
2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k + 1
\]

Thus, the sum up to \( k + 1 \):

\[
k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
\]

This completes the inductive step. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).

**3. Direct Calculation**

The first \( n \) odd natural numbers are: \( 1, 3, 5, \ldots, (2n - 1) \).

The sum of these numbers can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n - 1)
\]

This is an arithmetic series with:
- First term \( a = 1 \),
- Last term \( l = 2n - 1 \),
- Number of terms \( n \).

The sum \( S \) of an arithmetic series is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (a + l)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} [1 + (2n - 1)] \\
S = \frac{n}{2} (2n) \\
S = n \times n \\
S = n^2
\]

Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

These multiple methods confirm the result, ensuring its validity across different mathematical approaches.

**Conclusion:**

Through mathematical induction, the direct summation, and the arithmetic series formula, we have proven that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
