Alright, so I have this problem where I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what odd natural numbers are. They are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. Each of these is two more than the previous one. 

So, the sequence of the first n odd numbers would be: 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., up to the nth term. I need to add these up and show that their sum is equal to n squared.

Maybe I can try writing out the first few cases to see if there's a pattern.

For n = 1: The sum is just 1, and 1 squared is also 1. So, it works here.

For n = 2: The sum is 1 + 3 = 4, and 2 squared is also 4. Still works.

For n = 3: The sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, and 3 squared is 9. So, same here.

For n = 4: The sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, and 4 squared is 16. Okay, so far, so good. It seems like the formula is holding for these initial cases.

But how do I prove it for all natural numbers n? I remember that there are formulas for arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by (number of terms) multiplied by (first term plus last term) divided by 2. 

Let me apply that here. The first term is 1, and the common difference is 2. So, the nth term would be 1 + (n - 1)*2. Let me compute that: 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1. So, the last term is 2n - 1.

Now, using the arithmetic series formula, the sum S should be n*(first term + last term)/2. Plugging in the values:

S = n*(1 + (2n - 1))/2
Simplify the numerator: 1 + 2n - 1 = 2n
So, S = n*(2n)/2 = n*(n) = n squared.

Wait, that worked out! So, by applying the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, I showed that the sum of the first n odd numbers is indeed n squared.

But let me see if there's another way to think about this without using the arithmetic series formula. Maybe induction could also work here.

Okay, mathematical induction is a technique where you prove the base case, then assume it's true for some k and prove it for k + 1.

Base case: n = 1. As we saw, the sum is 1, which is equal to 1 squared. So, base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume that the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared. Now, we need to show that the sum of the first k + 1 odd numbers is (k + 1) squared.

The (k + 1)th odd number after k would be the next odd number after 2k - 1, which is 2k + 1. So, adding that to the assumed sum would be k squared + (2k + 1).

So, S_{k+1} = S_k + (2k + 1) = k squared + 2k + 1.

Simplify that: 2k + 1 + k squared is the same as (k + 1) squared because (k + 1)^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1.

Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the concept of telescoping series? I'm not sure if that's the case here, but since the arithmetic series formula worked, and induction also worked, both methods confirm the result.

Alternatively, maybe using a visual proof or a geometric interpretation. If I think of each odd number as a layer, adding to form a square. For example, the first odd number is 1, which is a 1x1 square. Adding 3 gives a 2x2 square, adding 5 gives a 3x3 square, and so on. Each addition of the next odd number extends the square by one unit on each side. So, after n such additions, you have an n x n square, whose area is n squared.

That's a neat and intuitive way to see it. It uses spatial reasoning to explain the algebraic formula.

Hmm, I think I've covered several methods to prove this: arithmetic series formula, mathematical induction, and a spatial, intuitive explanation. All of them lead to the same conclusion, so I feel confident that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared.

Just to recap:

1. **Arithmetic Series Formula**:
   - First term, a = 1
   - Common difference, d = 2
   - nth term, l = 1 + (n - 1)*2 = 2n - 1
   - Sum, S_n = n*(a + l)/2 = n*(1 + (2n - 1))/2 = n*(2n)/2 = n^2

2. **Mathematical Induction**:
   - Base case, n=1: Sum=1=1^2
   - Inductive step: Assume sum of first k odds is k^2, then sum of first k+1 odds is k^2 + (2k +1) = (k +1)^2

3. **Spatial Interpretation**:
   - Each odd number extends a square, building up to a final n x n square.

All methods confirm the same result, so I'm ready to present the proof formally using the arithmetic series formula, as the induction and spatial reasoning are understood in the thought process.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), which can be formally proven using the arithmetic series formula. This involves recognizing the sequence as an arithmetic progression and applying the sum formula to demonstrate that the sum simplifies to \( n^2 \).

\boxed{n^2}

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use the arithmetic series formula.

1. **Identify the sequence and its properties**:
   - The first \( n \) odd natural numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a = 1 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - The \( n \)-th term of this sequence is given by:
     \[
     l = 1 + (n - 1) \times 2 = 2n - 1
     \]

2. **Apply the arithmetic series formula**:
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (1 + (2n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2} \times 2n = n^2
     \]

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

\[
\boxed{n^2}
