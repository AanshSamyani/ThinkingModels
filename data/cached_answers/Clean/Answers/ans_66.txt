Alright, let's tackle this problem: "Prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n²." Hmm, okay. So, first, I should make sure I understand what the question is asking. It says "the sum of the first n odd natural numbers." So, if n is 1, then the first odd natural number is just 1. If n is 2, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. For n=3, it's 1 + 3 + 5, which is 9. Wait a minute, these sums are perfect squares! 1², 2², 3², etc. So, the statement seems to hold for the first few cases. That's a good start, but I need to prove it for any n, not just the first few examples.

Let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about arithmetic sequences and series. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term increases by a constant difference. In this case, the odd natural numbers form an arithmetic sequence because each term increases by 2. The first term is 1, and the common difference d is 2. 

So, the general formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S_n = n/2 × (first term + last term). Alternatively, it can also be written as S_n = n × average of the two terms. Hmm, but the problem is asking for the sum in terms of n squared, so maybe there's a more straightforward way to express the last term as well.

Wait, the problem is about the first n odd natural numbers. So, the first term is 1, the second is 3, the third is 5, and so on, up to the nth term. I wonder what the nth term is. Since each term is 2 more than the previous one, we can express the nth term as the first term plus (n - 1) times the common difference. So, that would be 1 + (n - 1)×2 = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1. Okay, so the nth term is 2n - 1.

Now, going back to the sum formula: S_n = n/2 × (first term + last term). Plugging in the values we have, first term is 1, last term is 2n - 1. So, S_n = n/2 × (1 + 2n - 1) = n/2 × (2n) = n × n = n². Whoa, so that actually works out perfectly! The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared. That makes sense because each pair of terms when added together gives an even number, and as you add more terms, the overall sum forms a square number.

But wait, let me make sure this reasoning isn't missing something. Maybe I should consider using another approach, like mathematical induction. That's another method used to prove statements that are supposed to be true for all natural numbers. Let me try that as well to double-check.

For mathematical induction, we need to show that the statement is true for the base case (usually n = 1) and that if it's true for some integer k, then it's also true for k + 1.

Base case: Let n = 1. The first odd natural number is 1. The sum is 1, and 1 squared is also 1. So, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume that the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is k². Now, we need to show that the sum of the first (k + 1) odd natural numbers is (k + 1)².

The sum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers is the sum of the first k odd numbers plus the (k + 1)th odd number. According to the inductive hypothesis, the first k sum to k². The (k + 1)th odd number is 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k + 1.

So, the total sum would be k² + (2k + 1) = k² + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)². Which is what we needed to show.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n.

Alternatively, I could think of this problem using algebra. Let's denote the sum as S_n. So, S_n = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1).

Another way to write S_n is by recognizing that it's the sum of an arithmetic progression. As I did before, the sum S_n = n/2 × (first term + last term) = n/2 × (1 + (2n - 1)) = n/2 × 2n = n².

But maybe I can also express it using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n(n + 1)/2, but wait, that's for consecutive numbers starting from 1, but here the numbers are different—they're all odd. So, that formula isn't directly applicable. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let's think about writing out the terms:

For n=1: 1=1²

n=2: 1 + 3=4=2²

n=3: 1 + 3 +5=9=3²

n=4: 1 +3 +5 +7=16=4²

And so on. Each time, the sum equals n squared.

But to prove this, using induction is the most straightforward. As we've already shown with induction for n=1, and the inductive step, it holds for all natural numbers.

Another thought: Maybe using the concept of sequences and series in calculus? Like, the difference between the sum and its previous sum forms a pattern that converges to a limit, but that might be overcomplicating things.

No, induction seems the easiest and most direct way to show this. So, bringing it all together, the proof is that by either induction or using the arithmetic series sum formula, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared.

But just to be thorough, let me also think about this in terms of graphing or visualizing it. If I plot the sum of the first n odd numbers, it's a perfect square. It grows quadratically, which is exactly what n squared represents. Each additional odd number added extends the sum just enough to form the next perfect square.

For example, from 1 to 4, we add 3, which is 2². From 4 to 9, we add 5, which is 3². From 9 to 16, we add 7, which is 4², and so on. Each time, the odd number we add is equal to 2n - 1, where n is the number of terms we've added so far. So, the increment is exactly the side length of the square we're building. Thus, after each addition, the total sum becomes a perfect square of increasing length.

Alternatively, thinking about how the sum builds up:

- Start with 1.

- Add 3 to get 4.

- Add 5 to get 9.

- Add 7 to get 16.

- Add 9 to get 25.

And so on, each time the sum is a perfect square. This seems to be a well-known property, but I think going through the proof step-by-step using induction or the arithmetic series formula solidifies our understanding.

In conclusion, whether through inductive reasoning or using the properties of arithmetic series, we've established that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared. This makes sense both numerically and algebraically, and it's a neat demonstration of how sequences and series can reveal patterns in mathematics.

The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).

**Proof:**

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**

The first odd natural number is 1. The sum is:
\[ S_1 = 1 \]
\[ 1^2 = 1 \]
Thus, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**

Assume that for some integer \( k \geq 1 \), the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is:
\[ S_k = 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) = k^2 \]

We need to show that:
\[ S_{k+1} = 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2 \]

Starting from the assumption:
\[ S_k = k^2 \]
Adding the next odd number:
\[ S_{k+1} = S_k + (2(k + 1) - 1) \]
\[ S_{k+1} = k^2 + (2k + 2 - 1) \]
\[ S_{k+1} = k^2 + (2k + 1) \]
\[ S_{k+1} = k^2 + 2k + 1 \]
\[ S_{k+1} = (k + 1)^2 \]

Thus, the statement holds for \( k + 1 \) if it holds for \( k \).

By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).
