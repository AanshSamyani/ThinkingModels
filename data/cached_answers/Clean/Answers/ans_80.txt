Okay, so I have this math problem here that says I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, that sounds interesting. I remember that natural numbers are just the counting numbers, like 1, 2, 3, and so on. Odd numbers would be 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So the first n odd numbers would be 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the nth odd number.

Let me write this down. The first n odd numbers would be:

1, 3, 5, ..., 2n-1.

So I need to add all these numbers together and show that it equals n squared. Maybe I can start by writing out the sum for small values of n to see if it works.

Let's try n = 1. The first odd number is 1. Sum is 1. n squared is 1 squared, which is also 1. So that works.

Now n = 2. First two odd numbers are 1 and 3. Sum is 1 + 3 = 4. 2 squared is 4. Still works.

n = 3. First three odd numbers: 1, 3, 5. Sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. 3 squared is 9. Cool.

n = 4. First four odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7. Sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. 4 squared is 16. Nice.

So it seems like this works for small values of n. That gives me some confidence, but I need a general proof for any n.

Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers. Let me think about how these odd numbers are structured. Each odd number can be expressed as 2k - 1, where k starts at 1. So the first term is when k=1: 2(1) -1 = 1. The second is 2(2) -1 = 3, and so on.

So the nth term would be 2n -1. Therefore, the sum S(n) of the first n odd numbers would be:

S(n) = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n -1).

Now, I need a way to find a formula for this sum. I remember that sometimes the sum of consecutive numbers can be represented as a series, and there are formulas for those. But I'm not sure about the sum of odd numbers specifically.

Wait, maybe I can pair the terms or find another pattern. Let's write out the sum:

1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n -1).

If I group them in pairs:

(1 + 2n -1) + (3 + 2n -3) + ... until I have n terms.

Simplifying each pair:

First pair: 1 + (2n -1) = 2n.

Second pair: 3 + (2n -3) = 2n.

Third pair: 5 + (2n -5) = 2n.

And so on.

Wait, that's interesting. Each pair adds up to 2n. How many pairs are there? Well, since there are n terms, if n is even, there would be n/2 pairs. If n is odd, the middle term would be alone, but 2n remains the same.

Wait, no, let's clarify. For n=4, 4 terms: two pairs, each summing to 2n=8. So the total sum is 2*8=16, which is indeed 4 squared.

Similarly, for n=3, 3 terms: two pairs and the middle term. Each pair sums to 6 (since 2*3=6), and the middle term is 5. So sum is 6 + 5=11, which is not 3 squared. Wait, that contradicts. What's wrong here?

Wait, no, in n=3 case, sum is 1 + 3 +5 =9, which is 3 squared. But my pairing was wrong.

Wait, wait, in the pairing I did earlier, I assumed each pair adds to 2n, but for n=3, 2n=6, but 1 +5=6, but 3 is the middle term. So 6 +3=9, which is correct.

So maybe the pairing works regardless of whether n is even or odd.

Let me try n=5. First five odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Sum is 1+3+5+7+9=25, which is 5 squared.

Now, pairing:

1 +9=10,

3 +7=10,

5 is the middle term.

Total sum is 10 +10 +5=25. Correct.

Another approach: Maybe using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

An arithmetic series has a formula: S = n/2 * (first term + last term).

Let's apply that.

First term is 1, last term is 2n -1.

Sum S(n) = n/2 * (1 + (2n -1)) = n/2 * (2n) = n^2.

Ah! There we go. That's a simpler way.

Wait, that's actually the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Since the odd numbers themselves form an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2, this formula applies here.

So using the arithmetic series formula, I can directly compute the sum as:

S(n) = n/2 * (first term + last term).

First term is 1, last term is 2n -1.

Thus, S(n) = n/2 * (1 + 2n -1) = n/2 * (2n) = n^2.

Yay! That works. So that proves that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared.

Wait, let me make sure this makes sense. Because earlier when I tried n=3, I thought there was a conflict, but now it's clear.

When n=3: arithmetic series with first term 1, last term 5. Sum is (3/2)(1 +5)= (3/2)(6)=9=3 squared.

Similarly, for n=4: first term 1, last term7. Sum is (4/2)(1+7)=2*8=16=4 squared.

Perfect. So this formula works for any n. Therefore, I've proven it.

But I need to make sure I didn't assume what I wanted to prove. I started with the arithmetic series formula, which applies to any arithmetic sequence, and since the odd numbers form such a sequence, I can use this formula.

So this seems solid. No need to think any further.

Final answer: The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared because the sum can be represented using the arithmetic series formula where the first term is 1, the last term is (2n -1), and applying the formula gives n squared.
</think>

The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \) because these numbers form an arithmetic sequence. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S(n) = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

Here, the first term is 1, and the last term is \( 2n - 1 \). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
S(n) = \frac{n}{2} \times (1 + (2n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2} \times 2n = n^2
\]

Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
