Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, what are the first n odd natural numbers? Well, odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, right? So the first few odd numbers would be 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. If n is, say, 5, then the first 5 odd numbers would be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Let me add those up: 1+3 is 4, 4+5 is 9, 9+7 is 16, 16+9 is 25. Wait, that's 25, and 5 squared is also 25. Interesting, that works for n=5. Let me try another one just to be sure.

Let’s say n=3. The first three odd numbers are 1, 3, 5. Adding them up: 1+3 is 4, 4+5 is 9. 3 squared is 9, so that works too. How about n=1? Well, the first odd number is just 1, so 1 squared is 1. That checks out. Okay, so it seems like for small n, this holds true. But I need to prove it for any n, not just specific cases.

So, how do I approach this in general? I remember something about arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula: Sum = (number of terms) multiplied by (first term plus last term) divided by 2. So, if I can express the first n odd numbers as an arithmetic series, I can apply this formula to find their sum.

Let me write down the general form of an arithmetic series. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference. For the sequence of odd numbers, what's the first term and the common difference?

Well, the first odd natural number is 1, so a_1 = 1. The difference between consecutive odd numbers is 2, because 3-1=2, 5-3=2, and so on. So, d = 2. Therefore, the nth term of the odd number sequence is a_n = 1 + (n-1)*2, which simplifies to a_n = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1. So, that makes sense—each term is 2n - 1 when n is the term number.

Now, back to the sum formula. The sum S of the first n terms is S = n*(a_1 + a_n)/2. I know that a_1 is 1, and a_n is 2n -1. So substituting those in, the sum becomes S = n*(1 + (2n -1))/2. Let's simplify inside the parentheses first: 1 + 2n -1 = 2n. So, now it's S = n*(2n)/2.

Simplify further: n*(2n)/2 = (2n^2)/2 = n^2. That's exactly what I was supposed to prove: the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared. So, my general formula with the arithmetic series gives me the desired result.

Let me double-check this with another example. Say n=6. The first six odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Adding them up: 1+3 is 4, 4+5 is 9, 9+7 is 16, 16+9 is 25, 25+11 is 36. 6 squared is 36, so that works too. Great, seems consistent.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using induction. Mathematical induction is often a solid method for proving statements that are supposed to hold for all natural numbers. Let me try that approach as well.

So, for mathematical induction, I need to show that the statement holds for the base case (usually n=1) and then assume it holds for some k and show it holds for k+1.

Base case: n=1. The first odd number is 1, and 1 squared is 1. So, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume that the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared. Now, I need to show that the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers is (k+1) squared.

The sum of the first k+1 odd numbers would be the sum of the first k odd numbers plus the (k+1)th odd number. According to the inductive hypothesis, the first k sum to k^2. The (k+1)th odd number can be expressed as 2(k+1) -1 = 2k +2 -1 = 2k +1.

So, the sum becomes k^2 + (2k +1). Let's compute that: k^2 + 2k +1 = (k +1)^2. Which is exactly what we needed to show. Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n.

Alright, so both the arithmetic series approach and mathematical induction support the conclusion. That gives me more confidence in the proof.

Wait a second, maybe another way to see it. I've heard that the sum of the first n odd numbers relates to squares of numbers. Let me think about the number line or some visualization.

Imagine placing the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 2n-1 on a number line. If you pair them up, perhaps you can see a pattern. For example, 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared; 3 + 5 = 8, which is 2*4, but 8 is not a square. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, think about the figure where you form squares with dots. For instance, a 1x1 square has 1 dot; a 2x2 square has 4 dots; a 3x3 square has 9 dots, and so on. Each square has a number of dots equal to the square of its side length. But how does that relate to the sum of odd numbers?

Wait, let's see. A 2x2 square has 4 dots, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Similarly, a 3x3 square has 9 dots, which is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. So, in general, the sum of the first n odd numbers equals n squared. So, arranging the dots in a square, each layer adds an odd number of dots to form the next square. That visual makes sense too.

So, whether I approach it through arithmetic series, mathematical induction, or visualizing squares, I keep getting that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared. That solidifies my understanding and proof.

I think I've covered several angles here. I approached it algebraically, with an arithmetic series formula, then tested it with induction, and even thought about visual representations. All of them point towards the same conclusion. So, I can confidently say that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed equal to n squared. It's interesting how different methods confirm the same result, ensuring its validity.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), so we have proven that \boxed{n^2}.
</think>

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use both arithmetic series and mathematical induction.

### Arithmetic Series Approach

1. The first \( n \) odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., \( 2n - 1 \).
2. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = n \cdot \frac{a_1 + a_n}{2}
   \]
   where \( a_1 \) is the first term, \( a_n \) is the \( n \)-th term, and \( n \) is the number of terms.
3. Here, \( a_1 = 1 \) and the \( n \)-th term \( a_n = 2n - 1 \).
4. Substituting these values into the sum formula:
   \[
   S = n \cdot \frac{1 + (2n - 1)}{2} = n \cdot \frac{2n}{2} = n^2
   \]

### Mathematical Induction

1. **Base Case:** For \( n = 1 \), the first odd number is 1, and \( 1^2 = 1 \). The base case holds.
2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the sum of the first \( k \) odd numbers is \( k^2 \). We need to show it for \( k + 1 \).
3. The sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd numbers is \( k^2 + (2(k + 1) - 1) \).
4. Simplifying:
   \[
   k^2 + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)^2
   \]
   Thus, the inductive step holds.

### Visual Representation

- A 2x2 square has \( 1 + 3 = 4 \) dots, which is \( 2^2 \).
- A 3x3 square has \( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \) dots, which is \( 3^2 \).
- This pattern continues, showing that the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers equals \( n^2 \).

### Final Answer
The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), so we have proven that \boxed{n^2}.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
