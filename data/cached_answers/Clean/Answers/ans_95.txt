Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's list out the first few odd natural numbers to get a better understanding. The first odd number is 1, then 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, for n equals 1, the sum is just 1. For n equals 2, it's 1 plus 3, which equals 4. For n equals 3, it's 1 plus 3 plus 5, which is 9. Wait a minute, these sums are 1, 4, 9—those are perfect squares. So, maybe there's a pattern here.

Let me test this pattern further. For n equals 4, the sum should be 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 7. That adds up to 16, which is 4 squared. Hmm, that's consistent. So, it seems like the sum is indeed n squared. But how can I prove this for any n?

I remember that induction is a common method for proving statements about natural numbers. Maybe I can use that. So, let's try mathematical induction.

First, the base case. When n equals 1, the sum is 1, which is equal to 1 squared, so the base case holds.

Now, assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, assume that the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is k squared. So, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k².

Now, we need to show that the statement holds for k + 1. That is, the sum of the first (k + 1) odd natural numbers should be (k + 1) squared.

So, let's add the next odd number, which is 2(k + 1) - 1, to both sides of our induction hypothesis. That would be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1). According to the hypothesis, this is equal to k² + (2k + 2 - 1) = k² + (2k + 1).

Simplify that: k² + 2k + 1. Wait, that's equal to (k + 1)². Because (k + 1)² = k² + 2k + 1. So, we've shown that if the sum up to k is k², then the sum up to k + 1 is (k + 1)². Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers that doesn't rely on induction. I recall that the sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: (number of terms) times (first term plus last term) divided by 2.

Let's apply this. The first term of the sequence of odd numbers is 1, and the nth term can be expressed as 2n - 1. So, plugging into the sum formula: n * (1 + (2n - 1)) / 2.

Simplify inside the parentheses: 1 + 2n - 1 = 2n. So, n * 2n / 2 = (2n²) / 2 = n². So, that confirms the sum is n squared.

Alternatively, I can also use algebraic manipulation. Let's consider that the sum S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1). If I write out the terms, it's:

S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1).

If I reverse the order and add them:

S = (2n - 1) + (2n - 3) + ... + 1.

Now, if I add these two equations term by term:

2S = (1 + (2n - 1)) + (3 + (2n - 3)) + ... + ((2n - 1) + 1).

Each pair sums to 2n. Since there are n terms, this becomes 2n * n = 2n².

Therefore, 2S = 2n², which implies S = n². This algebraic proof also shows that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared.

Wait, I remember there's also a geometric interpretation. If I arrange squares in a way that the number of squares corresponds to the odd numbers, adding up to a larger square. Maybe that's another way to visualize it, but I think the algebraic proof is more straightforward.

So, combining both the induction proof and the algebraic manipulation, I can be confident that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared.

The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \). 

To prove this, we can use the principle of mathematical induction.

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \))**:
The first odd natural number is 1. Thus, the sum is:
\[ 1 = 1^2 \]
The base case holds true.

**Inductive Step**:
Assume that for some integer \( k \geq 1 \), the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \). That is:
\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) = k^2 \]

We need to show that the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd natural numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 \).

Consider the sum up to \( k + 1 \):
\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) \]
Using the induction hypothesis:
\[ k^2 + (2k + 2 - 1) = k^2 + (2k + 1) \]
\[ = k^2 + 2k + 1 \]
\[ = (k + 1)^2 \]

Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers \( n \). Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
