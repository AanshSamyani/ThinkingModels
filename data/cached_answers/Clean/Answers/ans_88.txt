Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I have this problem that says I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, sounds interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand what the problem is asking. The "first n odd natural numbers" would be the sequence of odd numbers starting from 1 and continuing up to the nth odd number. So, for example, if n is 3, the first three odd numbers are 1, 3, 5. Their sum would be 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is equal to 3 squared, or 9. That seems to work, at least for n=3.

But I need to prove this for any n, not just for a specific case. How do I approach this? Maybe I can look for a pattern in the sum of the first few odd numbers and see if I can generalize it.

Let me list out the sums for the first few odd numbers:

- 1st odd number: 1
  Sum = 1
- 2nd odd number: 3
  Sum = 1 + 3 = 4
- 3rd odd number: 5
  Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
- 4th odd number: 7
  Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
- 5th odd number: 9
  Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25

Wait a minute, these sums are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25... Those are all perfect squares! 1², 2², 3², 4², 5², and so on. That's a good sign. It seems like the formula holds true for these cases.

But how can I show this is true in general? Maybe induction would be the way to go. Mathematical induction is a method of proving statements that make assertions about natural numbers, like these sums.

Alright, let me recall how mathematical induction works. It's based on two steps:

1. **Base Case**: Verify that the statement is true for the initial value, usually n=1.
2. **Inductive Step**: Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k, and then show that it must also be true for k+1.

If both steps are satisfied, then by mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers.

So, let's apply this to the problem.

**Base Case**: n = 1

The first odd number is 1. The sum is 1. Now, n² = 1² = 1. So, 1 = 1. The base case holds true.

**Inductive Step**: Assume the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is equal to k².

Wait, but I think there's another way to look at this. Maybe I should think about how the sum relates to the next odd number. That might help me set up the inductive step properly.

Let me consider S(k) as the sum of the first k odd numbers. So,

S(k) = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1)

I recall that the sum of the first k odd numbers can be expressed as k². But how can I formally prove that?

Maybe I can write the sum as:

S(k) = Σ (from i=1 to k) (2i - 1)

That's the sum of the first k odd numbers, where each term is 2i - 1.

So, expanding that, it's 2*1 - 1 + 2*2 - 1 + 2*3 - 1 + ... + 2*k - 1.

Wait, so each term is 2i - 1, so the entire sum becomes Σ 2i from i=1 to k minus Σ 1 from i=1 to k.

That's 2*Σ i from i=1 to k minus Σ 1 from i=1 to k.

I know that Σ i from i=1 to k is k(k+1)/2, and Σ 1 from i=1 to k is just k.

So plugging those in:

S(k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) - k

Simplify that:

2*(k(k+1)/2) cancels out the 2, leaving k(k+1). Then subtract k.

So,

S(k) = k(k+1) - k = k² + k - k = k²

So, S(k) = k². Thus, the inductive step is satisfied.

Wait, did I just solve it using the formula and induction? Maybe I should also try the induction approach as I thought earlier, to see if it aligns with what I just did.

Going back to the inductive step:

Assume that for some k, S(k) = k². Now, let's consider S(k+1), which is the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers.

That would be S(k+1) = S(k) + (2(k+1) - 1)

Because the next odd number after the kth is 2(k+1) - 1 = 2k + 1.

Wait, is that right? The kth odd number is 2k - 1, so the next one should be 2k + 1?

Wait, no, hold on. Let me correct that.

If the kth odd number is 2k - 1, then the (k+1)th odd number is 2(k+1) - 1, which equals 2k + 1.

Yes, that's correct.

So,

S(k+1) = S(k) + (2k + 1)

But by the induction hypothesis, S(k) = k². So,

S(k+1) = k² + (2k + 1) = k² + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)²

Which is exactly what we wanted to prove. Therefore, the statement holds for k+1 if it holds for k.

Thus, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n².

Wait, so that seems to cover both the base case and the inductive step, right?

Let me also try an alternative approach for double-checking. Maybe by using an algebraic identity.

I remember that the sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated as (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term). Maybe I can apply that here.

The first term is 1, and the last term is the nth odd number, which is 2n - 1. The number of terms is n.

So, S = n/2 * (1 + (2n - 1)) = n/2 * (2n) = n * n = n²

Ah, that's another way to see it. Since the odd numbers form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2, the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence applies here, and it simplifies nicely to n squared.

So, both approaches confirm that the sum is n squared.

Therefore, it's a proven statement that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared.

**Proof:**

We aim to prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).

1. **Understanding the Sequence:**
   - The first \( n \) odd natural numbers are: 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n - 1).

2. **Expressing the Sum:**
   - Let \( S(n) \) denote the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers.
   \[
   S(n) = 1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n - 1)
   \]

3. **Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The given sequence is an arithmetic progression (AP) with:
     - First term (\( a \)) = 1
     - Common difference (\( d \)) = 2
     - Number of terms (\( n \)) = \( n \)
   
   The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an AP is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} [2a + (n - 1)d]
   \]
   
4. **Applying the Formula:**
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     S(n) = \frac{n}{2} [2 \times 1 + (n - 1) \times 2] = \frac{n}{2} [2 + 2n - 2] = \frac{n}{2} \times 2n = n^2
     \]
   
5. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

This completes the proof.
