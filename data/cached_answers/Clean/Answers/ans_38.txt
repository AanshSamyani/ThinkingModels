Alright, so I have this problem where I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, let's clarify what the first n odd natural numbers are. The odd natural numbers start at 1, then go 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, for example, if n is 1, the first odd number is just 1. If n is 2, the first two odd numbers are 1 and 3. For n equals 3, it's 1, 3, 5. Got it.

Now, the sum of these numbers needs to equal n squared. Let me test this with some small values to see if it holds.

When n = 1: Sum is 1. 1 squared is also 1. So, that works.

When n = 2: Sum is 1 + 3 = 4. 2 squared is 4. Okay, still good.

When n = 3: Sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. 3 squared is 9. Perfect.

When n = 4: Sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. 4 squared is 16. Hmm, it seems consistent so far.

This gives me some confidence that the statement might be true. But I need a general proof, not just examples.

How can I prove this? Well, maybe I can use mathematical induction. That's a common method for proving statements like this. Let's recall how mathematical induction works.

First, I need to prove the base case, which is usually n = 1. Then, I assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary natural number k. Using this assumption, I need to prove that the statement then holds for k + 1.

So, let's start with the base case.

**Base Case (n = 1):**

Sum of the first 1 odd number = 1.

1 squared = 1.

So, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**

Assume that the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is equal to k squared. That is:

1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k².

Now, I need to show that the sum of the first k + 1 odd natural numbers is equal to (k + 1)².

Let's write out what that sum would be:

Sum of first k + 1 odd numbers = [Sum of first k odd numbers] + (2(k + 1) - 1).

Wait, let's see. The (k + 1)th odd number is 2(k + 1) - 1, which simplifies to 2k + 1.

So, the sum becomes:

Sum = k² + (2k + 1).

Let me compute that:

k² + 2k + 1.

Hmm, that factors into (k + 1)².

So, Sum of first k + 1 odd numbers = (k + 1)².

Therefore, if the statement holds for k, it also holds for k + 1.

**Conclusion:**

Since we've shown the base case holds and that if it holds for some arbitrary k, it holds for k + 1, by mathematical induction, the statement must be true for all natural numbers n.

Therefore, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared.

Alternatively, another way to look at this is by recognizing that the sequence of odd numbers forms an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = (number of terms) × (first term + last term) / 2.

In this case, the number of terms is n, the first term is 1, and the last term is the nth odd number, which is 2n - 1.

So, plugging into the formula:

Sum = n × (1 + (2n - 1)) / 2
Sum = n × (2n) / 2
Sum = n × n
Sum = n².

That's another way to derive the same result using the properties of arithmetic series.

Just to double-check, let's try n = 5.

Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25. 5 squared is 25. Perfect.

Alright, so both the induction method and the arithmetic series formula approach confirm that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared.
</think>

The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).

**Proof:**

We will prove this statement using mathematical induction.

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**

The first odd natural number is 1.

Sum = 1

\( 1^2 = 1 \)

Thus, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**

Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer \( k \); that is,

\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) = k^2 \]

We need to show that the statement holds for \( k + 1 \).

Consider the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd natural numbers:

\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) + [2(k + 1) - 1] \]

This simplifies to:

\[ k^2 + (2k + 1) \]

Combine the terms:

\[ k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2 \]

Thus, if the statement holds for \( k \), it also holds for \( k + 1 \).

**Conclusion:**

By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).

\[
\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i - 1) = n^2}
