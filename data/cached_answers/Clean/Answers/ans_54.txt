Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can start by listing out the first few odd numbers and see if I can spot a pattern or come up with a formula.

Alright, the first odd natural number is 1. If I take just that, the sum is 1. Now, adding the next odd number, which is 3, the sum becomes 1 + 3 = 4. Then, adding the next one, 5, the sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. Wait, I see a pattern here. The sums are 1, 4, 9, which are all perfect squares. That's interesting. So, if I continue this pattern, the next sum would be 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, which is 4 squared, right? So, it seems like each time I add the next odd number, the total becomes the next square.

But how can I generalize this? Maybe I can use mathematical induction. I remember that induction is a method where you prove the base case and then assume it's true for some n and show it holds for n + 1. So, let's try that.

First, the base case. When n = 1, the sum is just 1, and 1 squared is also 1. So, the base case holds.

Now, let's assume that for some k, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared. That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k².

Okay, now I need to show that the sum of the first k + 1 odd numbers is (k + 1)². So, starting with the sum up to k, which is k squared, and then adding the next odd number, which would be (2(k + 1) - 1) = 2k + 1. So, the sum becomes k² + (2k + 1).

Let's simplify that: k² + 2k + 1. Hmm, that looks like a perfect square. Yes, (k + 1)² = k² + 2k + 1. So, the sum of the first k + 1 odd numbers is indeed (k + 1)².

Therefore, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n. So, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared.

Wait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, maybe I should try another approach. Sometimes, visualizing the problem can help solidify the proof.

Let's consider arranging dots in a square formation. For instance, the number 1 can be represented by a single dot, which is a 1x1 square. Adding the next odd number, 3, would create a 2x2 square. Wait, 2x2 is 4, which is 1 + 3. Then adding the next odd number, 5, completes a 3x3 square. So, each time I add the next odd number, I'm essentially building up a larger square.

This geometric interpretation matches the algebraic proof I did earlier, so it reinforces the idea that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n².

Alright, I think I'm confident enough with the induction proof and the geometric interpretation to solidify that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared. I just need to write this out clearly in a step-by-step explanation.
</think>

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Base Case:**

For \( n = 1 \):
The sum of the first odd natural number is \( 1 \).
\( 1^2 = 1 \).
Thus, the statement holds for \( n = 1 \).

**Inductive Step:**

Assume that for some integer \( k \geq 1 \), the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \).
That is, 
\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) = k^2 \]

We need to show that the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd natural numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 \).

Consider the sum up to \( k + 1 \):
\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) \]

By the inductive hypothesis, the sum of the first \( k \) terms is \( k^2 \). Adding the next odd number \( 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1 \):
\[ k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2 \]

Thus, the statement holds for \( k + 1 \).

**Conclusion:**

By mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).

**Geometric Interpretation:**

We can visualize the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers as building up a square of side length \( n \). Each odd number represents the number of dots added in each successive layer around the previous square, effectively forming a larger square.

For example:
- The first odd number (1) forms a 1x1 square.
- The sum of the first two odd numbers (1 + 3) forms a 2x2 square.
- The sum of the first three odd numbers (1 + 3 + 5) forms a 3x3 square.
  
In general, adding the \( n \)-th odd number \( 2n - 1 \) completes the formation of a \( n \times n \) square, confirming that the sum is indeed \( n^2 \).

This visual and algebraic confirmation aligns with our mathematical proof, reinforcing the result.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
