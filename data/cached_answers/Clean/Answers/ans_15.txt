Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Alright, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, right? So the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on.

Let me write down the sum for the first few n to see if I can spot a pattern or figure out a way to prove it.

For n = 1:
Sum = 1
And 1 squared is 1, so it works.

For n = 2:
Sum = 1 + 3 = 4
And 2 squared is 4, so that checks out too.

For n = 3:
Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
And 3 squared is 9. Looks good.

For n = 4:
Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
4 squared is 16. Okay, consistent.

Hmm, so it seems to hold for these small values. But I need a general proof, not just checking individual cases. How can I prove that it holds for any natural number n?

Maybe I can use mathematical induction. I remember that mathematical induction involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is proving it works for the initial value, which we've done for n = 1. Now, I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k and then show it must be true for k + 1.

So let's set that up. Assume that the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is k squared. That is, assume:
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k²

Now, I need to show that the sum of the first k + 1 odd natural numbers is (k + 1)². The sum up to k + 1 would be:
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1)
Simplifying that last term:
2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k + 1

So, the sum is:
[1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1)] + (2k + 1) = k² + (2k + 1) [from the induction hypothesis]

Now, let's add those together:
k² + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)²

Wait, that's exactly what we wanted! So, the sum of the first k + 1 odd natural numbers is indeed (k + 1) squared. Since we've successfully shown that if the statement is true for k, it's also true for k + 1, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.

Hmm, let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to think about it, just to be sure.

Another approach could be visualizing the numbers as blocks or something. Maybe arranging them in a square? I remember something about pyramidal numbers or something like that.

Alternatively, I could consider that each odd number can be represented as 2k - 1 for k = 1, 2, 3, etc. So, the sum becomes:
Sum_{k=1 to n} (2k - 1)

Which is equal to 2 * Sum_{k=1 to n} k - Sum_{k=1 to n} 1
We know that Sum_{k=1 to n} k = n(n + 1)/2 and Sum_{k=1 to n} 1 = n
So, plugging those in:
2 * [n(n + 1)/2] - n = n(n + 1) - n = n² + n - n = n²

Oh, that's another way to see it without using induction. So, whether I use induction or expand the sum and simplify, I end up with n squared.

I think that solidifies the proof. Both methods lead to the same conclusion, so I'm confident in the result.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Base Case:**
For \( n = 1 \):
The sum is \( 1 \), which equals \( 1^2 \). Thus, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary natural number \( k \). That is, assume:
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k - 1) = k^2
\]
We need to show that:
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2
\]
Using the inductive hypothesis, the left-hand side becomes:
\[
k^2 + (2(k + 1) - 1) = k^2 + (2k + 2 - 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
\]
Thus, the statement holds for \( k + 1 \).

By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is indeed \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).

**Alternative Proof Using Summation:**
Consider the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers as:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
2 \sum_{k=1}^{n} k - \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1
\]
Using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, \( \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), and the sum of 1 \( n \) times, \( \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 = n \):
\[
2 \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - n = n(n + 1) - n = n^2 + n - n = n^2
\]
Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

Both methods confirm that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers equals \( n^2 \).
