Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. So, first off, I remember that the odd natural numbers start from 1 and go on like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. The question is saying that if I take the first n of these numbers and add them up, the result should be n squared. That sounds interesting and a bit tricky, but let's see how I can approach it.

Maybe I should start by writing out the formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers. Let's denote the sum as S. So, S is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + (2n-1). Now, I need to show that S equals n squared. Hmm, perhaps I can find a pattern by calculating S for small values of n and see if the result matches n squared.

Let me try n=1. The sum is just 1, and 1 squared is 1. That checks out. Okay, n=2. The sum is 1 + 3, which is 4. 2 squared is 4. That works too. What about n=3? 1 + 3 + 5 equals 9, and 3 squared is 9. Still good. Let me do one more, n=4. 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 equals 16, and 4 squared is 16. Nice, the pattern holds up so far. This gives me some confidence that the formula is likely correct, but I need a general proof.

So, how do I approach a general proof? Maybe I can use mathematical induction since it's a common method for proving statements that are supposed to hold for all natural numbers. Let me recall how mathematical induction works. First, I prove the base case, which is n=1 in this problem. Then, I assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary natural number k, and from there, I prove that it must also hold for k+1. That seems logical.

Let me start with the base case, which is n=1. The sum S is just 1, which equals 1 squared. So, the base case holds.

Now, let's assume that the statement is true for some natural number k. That is, the sum of the first k odd numbers is equal to k squared. So, by assumption, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k².

I need to show that if this is true for k, then it's also true for k+1. That means the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers should be (k+1) squared. So, let's write that down. The sum up to the (k+1)th term is S = [1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1)] + [2(k+1)-1].

Simplify that last term inside the sum. 2(k+1)-1 equals 2k+2 -1, which is 2k+1. So, S = [sum of first k terms] + (2k+1). But by the induction hypothesis, the sum of the first k terms is k squared. So, S = k² + (2k+1).

Now, let's compute k² + 2k +1. That can be rewritten as (k+1)^2, because (k+1)^2 = k² + 2k +1. So, S = (k+1)^2, which is exactly what we wanted to prove for the case when n=k+1.

Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n. The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared.

Wait, that was a bit smooth, but I think I got it. Maybe I can try another approach using sequences or series. Let me think about it.

I know that the odd numbers can be expressed as 2m -1 where m starts from 1. So, the sum S can be written as the sum from m=1 to n of (2m -1). So, S = Σ (2m -1) from m=1 to n.

This can be split into two separate sums: 2Σm from m=1 to n minus Σ1 from m=1 to n.

We know that Σm from m=1 to n is n(n+1)/2, and Σ1 from m=1 to n is just n. So, substituting that in:

S = 2*(n(n+1)/2) - n = n(n+1) - n = n² + n -n = n².

So, that also gives me S = n², which confirms the result again. This method seems a bit more algebraic and gives a better understanding of why the formula works.

Alternatively, I could visualize this. Imagine you have n rows of objects, each row having an odd number of objects. The first row has 1 object, the second has 3, the third has 5, and so on until the nth row which has (2n-1) objects. If you arrange all these objects together, maybe you can form a square. How would that work?

If I take two of them from the last row, the second row, and pair them with the first row, I might be able to make a rectangle. Then, if I do this for all the rows, perhaps the total area becomes a square. Let me try to sketch it out mentally.

When you add all these odd numbers, you're essentially building up a square where each side has length n. The extra objects from each row add up in such a way that they complete the square, making the area equal to n squared. That's an interesting way to think about it.

Another thought: since the odd numbers are like the distances you take to build a square, each step you make adds two to the total length but removes one in the process, balancing out to make a perfect square.

I also recall that there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which this seems like an arithmetic series since each term increases by 2. The formula is S = n/2 * (first term + last term). Applying that here, the first term is 1, and the last term is (2n-1). So:

S = n/2 * (1 + (2n-1)) = n/2 * (2n) = n * n = n².

That's another concise way to derive the same result, using the arithmetic series formula.

Wait, that seems redundant because I already did both induction and algebraic methods earlier. But it's good to have different methods to reinforce the result.

Let me consider the problem in another way: using geometric representations. If I arrange the numbers in a square, each new odd number added extends the square by one on both sides. For example:

- Start with 1 = 1².
- Add 3: 1 + 3 = 4 = 2².
- Add 5: 4 + 5 = 9 = 3².
- Add 7: 9 + 7 = 16 = 4².

Each time I add an odd number, it extends the square to the next integer. So, adding the nth odd number (which is 2n -1) completes the square from (n-1)² to n². Hence, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared.

Thinking in terms of patterns and sequences helps me see why the formula works. It builds up naturally as you add each odd number.

I also wonder how this generalizes to other series. For instance, if I take the sum of the first n even numbers, does that also have a similar formula? Well, the sum would be 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 2n. That's 2(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n). The sum inside is n(n+1)/2, so S = 2*(n(n+1)/2) = n(n+1). So, that's a different result, which makes sense because even numbers form a different sequence.

But going back, the sum of odd numbers being a square is a pretty neat result. It's not just a coincidence. I remember seeing that somewhere in math history, but I think the key here is recognizing that the odd numbers form a perfect square when added up.

To recap, I've used mathematical induction, algebraic manipulation, arithmetic series formula, and geometric visualization to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared. Each method provides a different perspective, but all confirm the result. This makes me confident that the statement is true and deeply understood.

One last check: let me write out the sum step by step for a few more n to ensure consistency.

For n=5: 1 + 3 + 5 +7 +9 = 25. 5 squared is 25. Nice.

For n=6: 25 + 11 = 36. 6 squared is 36. Perfect.

Okay, I think I've thoroughly checked it, and each time the formula holds up. This makes me feel confident that the proof is solid.

The sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals \( n^2 \).

**Proof:**

Let's denote the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers as \( S \). The odd numbers are \( 1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, (2n-1) \). Therefore, we can write:

\[
S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + \ldots + (2n - 1)
\]

To prove that \( S = n^2 \), we'll use mathematical induction.

**Base Case:**
For \( n = 1 \):
\[
S = 1 = 1^2
\]
The base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the statement is true for \( n = k \), i.e.,
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) = k^2
\]

Now, consider \( n = k + 1 \):
\[
S = [1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1)] + (2(k + 1) - 1)
\]
Using the inductive hypothesis:
\[
S = k^2 + (2k + 2 - 1) = k^2 + (2k + 1)
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
\]

Thus, if the statement holds for \( n = k \), it also holds for \( n = k + 1 \).

By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

**Alternative Proof:**
The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers can be written as:
\[
S = \sum_{m=1}^{n} (2m - 1)
\]
Split the sum:
\[
S = 2\sum_{m=1}^{n} m - \sum_{m=1}^{n} 1
\]
Calculate each sum:
\[
\sum_{m=1}^{n} m = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}, \quad \sum_{m=1}^{n} 1 = n
\]
Substitute back:
\[
S = 2\left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right) - n = n(n + 1) - n = n^2 + n - n = n^2
\]

Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

**Geometric Interpretation:**
Visualize adding the first \( n \) odd numbers as building a square. Each odd number adds a layer to the square, increasing its side length by one. Thus, after adding the \( n \)-th odd number, the total forms a perfect square of side length \( n \), resulting in an area of \( n^2 \).

This completes the proof.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
