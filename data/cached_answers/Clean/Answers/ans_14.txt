Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let's see. I remember that odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. They are numbers that can be expressed in the form 2k + 1, where k is a non-negative integer. So the first few odd numbers are 1 (when k=0), 3 (k=1), 5 (k=2), and so on.

Now, I need to find the sum of these numbers and see if it's equal to n squared. Let me start by writing out the first few sums to see if I can notice a pattern.

When n=1: The first odd number is 1. So the sum is 1, which is 1 squared.

When n=2: The sum is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared.

When n=3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3 squared.

When n=4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, which is 4 squared.

Hmm, okay, so it seems like the sum is always n squared. But I need to prove it generally, not just check examples.

Maybe I can use mathematical induction. That's a common method for proving statements that are supposed to hold for all natural numbers. Induction involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step.

First, let's establish the base case. For n=1, the sum is 1, and 1 squared is 1, so the base case holds.

Now, for the inductive step, let's assume that the statement holds for some integer k. That is, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared. I need to show that this implies the statement holds for k + 1.

So, the sum of the first k + 1 odd numbers would be the sum of the first k odd numbers plus the (k + 1)th odd number. According to my induction hypothesis, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared. The (k + 1)th odd number is just 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1.

Therefore, the sum of the first k + 1 odd numbers would be k squared + (2k + 1). Let's simplify that:

k² + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)².

Yes, that's correct. So, if the statement holds for n = k, then it also holds for n = k + 1.

Since both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n. Therefore, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared.

Alright, let's provide a clear step-by-step proof using mathematical induction to show that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

We aim to prove that:
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n - 1) = n^2
\]
This is known as mathematical induction.

**Step 2: Base Case**

First, we verify the statement for \( n = 1 \).

Sum of the first 1 odd number:
\[
1 = 1^2 = 1
\]
The base case holds true.

**Step 3: Inductive Hypothesis**

Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer \( k \). That is:
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) = k^2
\]

**Step 4: Inductive Step**

We need to show that the statement holds for \( k + 1 \). That is:
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2
\]
Let's simplify the left-hand side (LHS):

Using the inductive hypothesis, the sum up to the \( k \)th term is \( k^2 \). Adding the \( (k+1) \)th odd number \( 2(k+1) - 1 = 2k + 1 \):
\[
k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
\]

**Step 5: Conclusion**

Since the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \) assuming it holds for \( n = k \), by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers \( n \).

Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
