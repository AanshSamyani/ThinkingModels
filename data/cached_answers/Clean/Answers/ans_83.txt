Alright, so I've got this math problem here that says the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. I need to prove that. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First off, what's an odd natural number? Well, natural numbers are just the counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. An odd one would then be every other number starting from 1: 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. So the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.

Now, I need to find the sum of the first n of these numbers and show that it equals n². Let's write down what that sum looks like for some small values of n to get a feel for it.

For n=1: The sum is just 1. That's straightforward. 1² is 1. So it works here.

For n=2: The sum is 1 + 3 = 4. And 2² is 4. Still good.

n=3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. 3² is 9. Still matching up.

n=4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. 4² is 16. Wow, so far so good.

n=5: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25. 5² is 25. I feel like this pattern is solid, but I should test it for n=10.

n=10: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19. Let me add these up step by step.

1 + 3 = 4; 4 + 5 = 9; 9 + 7 = 16; 16 + 9 = 25; 25 + 11 = 36; 36 + 13 = 49; 49 + 15 = 64; 64 + 17 = 81; 81 + 19 = 100. Yep, 10² is 100. So far, my hypothesis holds.

So, by mathematical induction or perhaps just seeing this pattern, it seems plausible. But how do I turn this into a formal proof?

Let me recall the principle of mathematical induction. To prove that a statement holds for all natural numbers n, I need to do two things: the base case, and then the inductive step.

Base case: Show that the statement holds for n=1.

As we saw earlier, the first odd number is 1, and the sum is 1, which is equal to 1². So the base case is proven.

Inductive step: Assume that the statement holds for some integer k, meaning that the sum of the first k odd numbers is k². Then, I need to show that the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers is (k+1)².

Wait, let's make sure I got that right. The first k odd numbers sum to k², and the first k+1 numbers would just be the sum of the first k numbers plus the next one, which is the (k+1)th odd number.

What is that (k+1)th odd number? Let's figure that out.

The first odd number is 1, which is 2×1 - 1.

The second is 3, which is 2×2 - 1.

Third is 5, which is 2×3 -1.

So, the kth odd number is 2k - 1.

Therefore, the (k+1)th odd number is 2(k+1) - 1 = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k +1.

So, the sum up to the (k+1)th odd number is k² + (2k +1).

Let me compute that: k² + 2k +1. That factors into (k+1)², because (k+1) squared is k² + 2k +1. So that works.

Therefore, if the sum of the first k odd numbers is k², then the sum of the first k+1 is (k+1)². Hence, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me go through it again.

Base case: n=1, sum=1=1². True.

Assume for n=k: sum= k².

Then, for n=k+1: sum= k² + (2k+1). Simplify: k² +2k +1 = (k+1)².

Hence, proven by induction.

But, another way to think about it, maybe without induction, is using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Since the odd numbers form an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2.

Wait, the general formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 × (first term + last term). Let's see.

We have n terms, starting from 1, each term increasing by 2.

So, the first term a1=1.

The nth term, which is the last term, is a_n=1 + (n-1)*2= 1 + 2n -2 = 2n -1.

So, the last term is 2n-1.

Then, the sum S_n is (n)/2 × (a1 + a_n)= n/2 × (1 + (2n-1))= n/2 × 2n = n × n= n².

Yup, that's another way to see it.

So, whether using induction or the arithmetic series formula, we arrive at the conclusion that the sum is n².

Just to be thorough, let me think if there's another perspective. Maybe using mathematical induction but starting with an empty set and building it up.

Alternatively, think about pairing numbers. If I pair the first and last numbers in the sequence of odd numbers, their sum is 1 + (2n-1) = 2n.

Similarly, the next pair would be 3 + (2n-3) = 2n.

Continuing this pattern, each pair sums to 2n, and if there are n terms, how many pairs do we have? Since n might be odd or even, but in either case, we can think of them as n terms.

But wait, for n even, it's straightforward: you can pair all of them into n/2 pairs each summing to 2n, so total sum would be n/2 × 2n= n².

For n odd, say n=2k+1, then we have k pairs each summing to 2n, but also have an extra middle term, which is 2k+1.

Wait, maybe this approach is complicating things.

Let me stick with the two methods I already have: mathematical induction and arithmetic series formula. Both lead to the same conclusion.

Another thought: maybe using geometry. If I arrange the numbers in a square formation. For example, the number of dots needed to form a square is the sum of the first n odd numbers.

Visualization: 1 dot is a 1x1 square. 1+3=4 is a 2x2 square. 1+3+5=9 is a 3x3 square, and so on. So, the sum of the first n odd numbers forms a perfect square of side length n. Hence, the sum equals n². But that's more of a visual explanation rather than a formal proof.

Alternatively, using sequences and series in calculus, but that seems overkill for this problem.

So, summarizing, the two proofs I can think of are:

1. Mathematical induction: Show that it holds for n=1, assume it holds for n=k, then show it holds for n=k+1.

2. Using the arithmetic series formula: Use the sum formula for an arithmetic series with n terms, first term 1, common difference 2, last term 2n-1, which simplifies to n².

Both approaches lead to the same result, so the statement is proven.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Base Case:**

For \( n = 1 \):
\[
1^2 = 1
\]
The sum of the first odd number is 1, which equals \( 1^2 \). Thus, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**

Assume that for some integer \( k \geq 1 \), the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \). That is:
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) = k^2
\]

We need to show that the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd natural numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 \):
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2
\]

Using the inductive hypothesis:
\[
k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
\]
Thus, the statement holds for \( k + 1 \).

By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).

**Alternative Proof using Arithmetic Series:**

The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers can be considered as an arithmetic series with:
- First term \( a = 1 \)
- Common difference \( d = 2 \)
- Number of terms \( n \)

The \( n \)-th term of this series is:
\[
a_n = a + (n - 1)d = 1 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 1
\]

The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms is:
\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a + (n - 1)d] = \frac{n}{2} [2(1) + (n - 1)(2)] = \frac{n}{2} [2 + 2n - 2] = \frac{n}{2} [2n] = n^2
\]

Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is indeed \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
