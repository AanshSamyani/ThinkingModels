Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.

Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, where do I start? Maybe I should list out the first few odd numbers and add them up to see if there's a pattern. 

The first odd number is 1. If n is 1, then the sum is just 1, which is 1 squared. That checks out.

The second odd number is 3. If n is 2, the sum is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared. Still works.

Let's try n=3. The third odd number is 5. So 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. Yep, 3 squared is 9. Interesting, this seems to hold so far.

Wait a minute, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each time I add the next odd number, the sum increases by an odd number. Like, after 1 it goes up by 3 to 4, then up by 5 to 9, then up by 7 to 16, and so on. Maybe there's a connection between consecutive odd numbers and squares.

I recall that odd numbers can be represented as 2k + 1, where k starts at 0. So the first term when k=0 is 1, the second when k=1 is 3, then 5, etc. Maybe if I write out the general term, I can find a sum formula.

Let's denote the ith term as a_i = 2i - 1 for i from 1 to n. So the sum S_n would be the sum from i=1 to n of (2i - 1). Let me write that out: S_n = (2*1 - 1) + (2*2 - 1) + ... + (2n - 1).

Breaking that down, that's (2 - 1) + (4 - 1) + ... + (2n - 1) = (1) + (3) + (5) + ... + (2n-1).

Wait, this is the sum of the first n odd numbers, which is what we're trying to find. So we need to compute this sum and show that it equals n squared.

Let me try to compute S_n. Maybe I can express it as two separate sums: 2*(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) minus (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n). So S_n = 2*(sum from 1 to n of i) - (sum from 1 to n of i).

I know that the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2. So substituting that in, S_n = 2*(n(n+1)/2) - (n(n+1)/2) = n(n+1) - n(n+1)/2.

Wait, let me compute that. 2*(n(n+1)/2) is n(n+1). So then S_n = n(n+1) - n(n+1)/2. Let's combine these terms.

n(n+1) is equal to 2n(n+1)/2, so subtracting n(n+1)/2 gives us [2n(n+1) - n(n+1)] / 2 = [n(n+1)] / 2.

Wait a minute, that doesn't seem right because earlier for n=3, the sum was 9, and according to this formula, it would be (3)(4)/2 = 6, which is not 9. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me go back. Maybe I confused the number of terms. When I expressed the ith term as a_i = 2i -1, that starts at i=1. So when I sum from i=1 to n, I have n terms. However, when I substitute, I might have missed the fact that the sum is actually 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1). That's n terms, each increasing by 2. 

So perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe using mathematical induction. Let me recall how induction works. 

Base case: n=1. Sum is 1, which is 1 squared. True.

Inductive step: Assume that the statement is true for n=k, that is, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared. Now, we need to show that the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers is (k+1)^2.

The sum for n=k+1 would be the sum for n=k plus the (k+1)th odd number. The (k+1)th odd number is 2(k+1) - 1 = 2k +1.

So S_{k+1} = S_k + (2k +1) = k^2 + 2k +1 = (k+1)^2. Thus, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.

Wait, that makes sense. So instead of trying to find the formula directly, I can use induction. Let me write that out clearly.

Base case: n=1. Sum =1, which equals 1^2. True.

Inductive hypothesis: Assume that for some integer k ≥1, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k^2.

Inductive step: We need to show that the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers is (k+1)^2.

Sum_{i=1}^{k+1} a_i = Sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i + a_{k+1} = k^2 + a_{k+1}.

The (k+1)th odd number is 2(k+1) -1 = 2k +1.

So Sum = k^2 + 2k +1 = (k^2 + 2k +1) = (k+1)^2. Which completes the inductive step.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.

I think that works. Let me check it again for n=3. Sum should be 1 + 3 +5 =9, which is 3^2. Yep, it matches. For n=4, 1+3+5+7=16=4^2. Perfect.

Maybe there's another way to see it geometrically. Each odd number can represent the number of dots in a square. So adding them up would form a square number. But I think the algebraic approach suffices.

Alternatively, I remember that the sum of the first n odd numbers can be visualized as layers of squares. Like, starting with 1, adding 3 makes a 2x2 square, adding 5 makes a 3x3, and so on. Each odd number adds a layer to form the next square, which naturally leads to the sum being n squared.

But I think the inductive proof is more straightforward and convincing. It's always reassuring to see different ways to approach the same problem.

So, to summarize, the first n odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n-1). The sum of these numbers is n^2. We proved this using mathematical induction: showed it's true for n=1, assumed it's true for some k, then showed it's true for k+1. Hence, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.

I think that covers it. No steps seem missing. Just need to present the induction clearly.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Proof by Mathematical Induction:**

1. **Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
   - The first odd natural number is 1.
   - Sum = 1
   - \( 1^2 = 1 \)
   - Thus, the statement holds for \( n = 1 \).

2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**
   - Assume that the statement is true for some integer \( k \geq 1 \). That is:
     \[
     1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) = k^2
     \]

3. **Inductive Step (\( n = k + 1 \)):**
   - We need to show that:
     \[
     1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2
     \]
   - Using the inductive hypothesis:
     \[
     k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
     \]
   - Therefore, the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).

Hence, the proof is complete.
