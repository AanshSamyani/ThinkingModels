Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, where do I start? Let me think about this step by step.

First, what exactly are the odd natural numbers? Well, natural numbers are like 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. Odd numbers are the ones that aren't divisible by 2, so they're 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. So the first n odd numbers would be like the first one, the third one, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The first odd number is 1, the second is 3, the third is 5, and so on, right? So the sequence of the first n odd numbers is 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the nth odd number.

Now, the problem is asking me to sum these up and show that the total is n squared. I need to find a general expression or formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.

When n = 1: 1
n = 2: 1 + 3 = 4
n = 3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
n = 4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16

Wait a minute, these results look familiar. For n = 1, the sum is 1 which is 1 squared. For n = 2, the sum is 4 which is 2 squared. For n = 3, it's 9, which is 3 squared. And for n = 4, it's 16, which is 4 squared. So, seems like the sum of the first n odd numbers is indeed n squared. But how can I prove this for any n?

I think induction might be a good approach here. Mathematical induction is a method of proving statements about natural numbers. It involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me try that.

**Base Case:** Let's check if the statement holds for n = 1. The first odd number is 1, so the sum is 1. 1 squared is also 1. So, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:** Assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, assume that the sum of the first k odd numbers is equal to k squared. Symbolically, this would be:

1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k².

Now, I need to show that the statement holds for k + 1. That is, the sum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers is equal to (k + 1) squared. Let me write this out.

Sum up to the first (k + 1) odd numbers would be:

[Sum up to k odd numbers] + (2(k + 1) - 1).

From the inductive hypothesis, we know that the sum up to k is k², so this becomes:

k² + [2(k + 1) - 1].

Let me simplify that step:

2(k + 1) = 2k + 2, so subtracting 1 gives 2k + 1.

So now, the sum up to (k + 1) is:

k² + 2k + 1.

Hmm, k² + 2k + 1 is the same as (k + 1) squared because:

(k + 1)² = k² + 2k + 1.

So, that's exactly what we wanted to show: that the sum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers is equal to (k + 1) squared.

Wait, so since the base case holds and if the statement holds for some k, it then holds for k + 1, by induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.

But wait, let me just think again if I got this correctly. So, the inductive step, by assuming that the sum up to k is k², I added the next odd number, which is 2(k + 1) - 1, which simplifies to 2k + 1. So the sum becomes k² + 2k + 1, which factors into (k + 1)². That's solid.

Let me try another approach just to verify. Maybe an arithmetic series approach.

An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers with a constant difference between consecutive terms. In this case, the odd numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term a = 1 and the common difference d = 2. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:

Sum = (n/2)(2a + (n - 1)d).

Let's plug in the values:

Sum = (n/2)(2*1 + (n - 1)*2) = (n/2)(2 + 2n - 2) = (n/2)(2n) = n².

Whoa, that worked too! So using both mathematical induction and the arithmetic series formula gave me the same result. That gives me more confidence that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared.

But just to be thorough, let me try to visualize this. Imagine arranging the numbers in some way that forms a square. For example, 1 is a 1x1 square, 1 + 3 is a 2x2 square, 1 + 3 + 5 is a 3x3 square, and so on. That visual makes the statement hold true because each step adds a layer of odd numbers that completes a larger square.

Another thought: these odd numbers are also called the "sequence of odd integers". It's interesting how they fit into mathematical structures like squares. This problem is a nice intersection point of arithmetic sequences and geometric figures.

Wait, I just thought of something. There's also a proof using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, which I did earlier. Let me write that down more clearly.

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is:

Sum = (number of terms)/2 * [2*(first term) + (number of terms - 1)*common difference]

In this case, number of terms is n, first term is 1, common difference is 2. So,

Sum = n/2 [2*1 + (n - 1)*2] = n/2 [2 + 2n - 2] = n/2 [2n] = n².

Yup, that's consistent with my earlier findings.

Let me also consider a different perspective. The nth odd number can be represented as 2n - 1. So, the sequence of the first n odd numbers is 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n - 1). So, the sum can be written as:

Sum = Σ_{k=1 to n} (2k - 1)

Which can be split into two separate sums:

Sum = Σ_{k=1 to n} 2k - Σ_{k=1 to n} 1

We know that Σ_{k=1 to n} 2k = 2 * Σ_{k=1 to n} k = 2*(n(n + 1)/2) = n(n + 1)

And Σ_{k=1 to n} 1 = n

So, the total sum is n(n + 1) - n = n² + n - n = n².

That's another way to look at it, using summation formulas.

Wait, that's similar to using the arithmetic series formula but broken down into individual components.

Alternatively, if I think about pairing terms, although that might not be as straightforward with an odd number count.

Hmm, I think I've covered multiple methods here:

1. Base case and inductive step using mathematical induction
2. Arithmetic series formula
3. Using the representation of the nth odd number as 2n - 1 and summing it directly
4. Pairing terms in some way

So, all these methods confirm the result. I can't think of any other angles here, but I feel pretty confident now that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared.

Just to ensure I haven't overlooked anything, let me test it with n = 5.

First, sum of first 5 odd numbers: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25. Which is 5 squared, correct.

Using the arithmetic series formula: n = 5, a = 1, d = 2.

Sum = 5/2 [2*1 + (5 - 1)*2] = 5/2 [2 + 8] = 5/2 * 10 = 25.

Perfect. It matches.

Another one: n = 6.

1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36, which is 6 squared. Correct again.

Using the formula: n = 6, a = 1, d = 2.

Sum = 6/2 [2*1 + (6 - 1)*2] = 3 [2 + 10] = 3 * 12 = 36.

Yup, matches.

So, after going through different methods and checking specific cases, I can confidently say that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared.
</think>

The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \). Here's a step-by-step proof using mathematical induction:

**Base Case (n = 1):**
- The first odd natural number is 1.
- Sum = 1.
- \( 1^2 = 1 \).
- Hence, the statement holds for \( n = 1 \).

**Inductive Step:**
- **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for some integer \( k \geq 1 \). That is, the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \).
- **Sum up to the \( (k + 1) \)th odd number:**
  - Sum up to \( k \) terms = \( k^2 \).
  - The next odd number after the \( k \)th term is \( 2k + 1 \).
  - Therefore, the sum up to the \( (k + 1) \)th term is \( k^2 + (2k + 1) \).
- **Simplify:**
  - \( k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2 \).
- **Conclusion:** The sum of the first \( (k + 1) \) odd natural numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 \).

Since the base case holds and the inductive step is proven, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).
