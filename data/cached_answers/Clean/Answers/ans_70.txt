Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., and they increase by 2 each time. The first few odd numbers are 1 (when n=1), 1+3=4 (n=2), 1+3+5=9 (n=3), and so on. Wait, that looks familiar. When I add the first n odd numbers, the sum is n squared. So for example, when n is 1, 1 equals 1 squared. When n is 2, 1+3 equals 4, which is 2 squared. When n is 3, 1+3+5 equals 9, which is 3 squared. Okay, so this seems to hold for these small cases. But I need to prove it in general, not just for specific numbers.

I think I should use mathematical induction because it's a reliable method for proving statements that are asserted to be true for all natural numbers. Let me recall how mathematical induction works. There are two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. In the base case, I need to show that the statement holds true for the first natural number, usually n=1. In the inductive step, I assume that the statement holds true for some arbitrary natural number k, and then I show that it must also hold true for k+1.

Okay, let me apply this to the problem. First, the base case: when n=1, the sum of the first 1 odd natural number is just 1. And 1 equals 1 squared, which is true. So, the base case holds.

Now, let me assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k. That means the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is equal to k squared. In other words, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k². This is my inductive hypothesis.

Next, I need to prove that the statement holds for k+1, which would mean showing that the sum of the first (k+1) odd natural numbers is equal to (k+1) squared. Let's write this out.

The sum of the first (k+1) odd natural numbers is equal to the sum of the first k odd natural numbers plus the next odd number after (2k-1). Since the odd numbers are spaced by 2, the next odd number after (2k-1) is (2k-1) + 2 = 2k + 1. So, the sum becomes:

1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2k+1).

From my inductive hypothesis, I know that the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared. So, substituting that in, I get:

k² + (2k+1).

Now, I need to simplify this expression and show that it equals (k+1) squared. Let's expand (k+1) squared:

(k+1)² = k² + 2k + 1.

So, I have k² + 2k + 1 on the left side and (k+1)² on the right side. They are equal, which completes the inductive step.

Since both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, by mathematical induction, the statement holds true for all natural numbers n. Therefore, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed equal to n squared.
</think>

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**

The first odd natural number is 1. Thus, the sum is:
\[
1 = 1^2
\]
The base case holds true.

**Inductive Step:**

Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number \( k \), i.e.,
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) = k^2
\]
We need to show that the statement holds for \( k + 1 \), i.e.,
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
\]
Thus, the statement holds for \( k + 1 \).

**Conclusion:**

By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).

\[
\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i - 1) = n^2}
