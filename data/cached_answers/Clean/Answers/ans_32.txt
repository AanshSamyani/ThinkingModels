To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Step 1: Base Case**

For \( n = 1 \):
\[
1 = 1^2 = 1
\]
The base case holds true.

**Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**

Assume that the statement is true for some integer \( k \), i.e.,
\[
\text{Sum of the first } k \text{ odd numbers} = k^2
\]

**Step 3: Inductive Step**

We need to show that the statement holds for \( k + 1 \).

Consider the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd numbers:
\[
\text{Sum} = k^2 + (2k + 3)
\]
Simplify:
\[
\text{Sum} = k^2 + 2k + 3 = (k + 1)^2 + 2
\]
This shows that the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 + 2 \), which matches the form we are trying to prove.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

By mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is indeed equal to \( n^2 \).

\[
\boxed{n^2}
