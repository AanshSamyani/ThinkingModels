Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me start by writing down what I know. The first few odd natural numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, if I add up the first n of these, the result should be n².

Let me write this out formally. Let S be the sum of the first n odd natural numbers. So,

S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + (2n - 1)

Wait, why is the last term (2n - 1)? Let me check that. When n = 1, the first odd number is 1, which is 2(1) - 1 = 1. For n = 2, it should be 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2² = 4. That works. For n = 3, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3² = 9. Okay, so my formula seems to hold for small values. That’s a good sign.

Now, I need to find a way to prove this generally. How can I approach this? Maybe I can use mathematical induction since it's a common method for proving statements about natural numbers.

Alright, let's recall how mathematical induction works. First, I need to show that the statement holds for the initial case, usually n = 1. Then, I assume it's true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and using this assumption, I prove that the statement holds for k + 1. If I can do both, then by induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.

Let me try this. Base case: n = 1. S = 1. And 1² = 1. So, it holds for n = 1.

Inductive step: Assume that for some integer k ≥ 1, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k². Now, I need to show that S + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)².

Wait, because if there are k terms, and I add the next odd number, which is (2k + 1), then there should be k + 1 terms. Let me write that:

S_{k+1} = S_k + (2k + 1) = k² + (2k + 1) = 2k² + 2k + 1? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, k² + 2k + 1 is (k + 1)².

Yes, exactly! So, S_{k+1} = k² + (2k + 1) = k² + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)². Perfect! That works.

Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's another way to see this without induction, like using algebraic manipulation or pairing terms.

Another approach: Observe that each odd number can be expressed as 2m - 1 for some m. So, the first n odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n - 1). Then, the sum S is the sum from m = 1 to m = n of (2m - 1).

So,

S = Σ_{m=1}^{n} (2m - 1) = 2 Σ_{m=1}^{n} m - Σ_{m=1}^{n} 1

I know that Σ_{m=1}^{n} m is n(n + 1)/2, and Σ_{m=1}^{n} 1 is just n. Plugging these in:

S = 2*(n(n + 1)/2) - n = (n(n + 1)) - n = n² + n - n = n².

So, using summation formulas, I arrive at S = n² directly, without induction. This seems more straightforward.

Wait, but did I miss anything? Both methods seem correct. The induction proof is solid, and the algebraic summation approach is also valid. Maybe I can consider an alternative proof using mathematical properties.

Another idea: Think about the pattern in the sums. The first few sums are 1, 4, 9, 16, which are the squares of 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. So, the sum of the first n odd numbers seems to be n squared.

Maybe I can also visualize this. If I represent each odd number as a row of dots, then adding them up forms a square. For example, 1 dot, then 3 dots forming a larger square, then adding 5 dots to make a 2x2 square, and so on. Each step adds a ring around the previous square, forming a new layer which is the next odd number.

Alternatively, using the concept of arithmetic series. Since the odd numbers form an arithmetic sequence with the first term a1 = 1 and common difference d = 2, the sum of n terms can be calculated using the formula S = n/2 * [2a1 + (n - 1)d]. Plugging in the values:

S = n/2 * [2*1 + (n - 1)*2] = n/2 * [2 + 2n - 2] = n/2 * [2n] = n².

That's another way to see it, using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

Hmm, so I've approached it algebraically, through induction, using summation formulas, visualizing the pattern, and through arithmetic series. All these methods lead to the same result: the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared. I think this covers different angles to ensure the proof is solid.

Wait, but is there a possibility that the initial terms don't hold? Let me check with n = 0. The sum of the first 0 odd numbers is 0, which is 0² = 0. That works too. So, the formula holds for all non-negative integers n.

Alright, I think I've thought this through enough. All methods confirm that S = n² when summing the first n odd natural numbers. I should present a clear, step-by-step proof using at least one method, preferably algebraic, as that might be the most straightforward for most readers.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use the summation formula for an arithmetic series. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify the Series**: The first \( n \) odd natural numbers form an arithmetic sequence where:
   - The first term (\( a_1 \)) is \( 1 \).
   - The common difference (\( d \)) is \( 2 \).

2. **Sum of an Arithmetic Series Formula**:
   The sum (\( S \)) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]
   \]

3. **Plug in the Values**:
   Substitute \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( d = 2 \) into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times [2 \times 1 + (n - 1) \times 2]
   \]

4. **Simplify the Expression**:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times [2 + 2n - 2] = \frac{n}{2} \times [2n] = n \times n = n^2
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

This proof confirms that regardless of the value of \( n \) (as long as \( n \) is a positive integer), the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers will always equal \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
