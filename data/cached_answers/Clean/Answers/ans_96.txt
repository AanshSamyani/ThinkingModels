Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Alright, so I'm trying to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Okay, let's break this down. First, let's understand what the problem is asking. The first n odd natural numbers would be like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, up to the nth term. So, if n is 1, the first odd number is just 1. For n=2, it would be 1+3=4, which is 2 squared. That seems to check out. Maybe I can test it with a few more numbers to see the pattern.

Let's try n=3. The first three odd numbers are 1, 3, 5. Adding them up: 1+3+5=9, which is 3 squared. Okay, another one that works. Let's go for n=4. So, 1+3+5+7=16, and 4 squared is 16. That still works. So, empirically, the formula seems to hold for these small values of n. That gives me some confidence to move forward with the proof.

But how do I go about proving this? Maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that relates the sum of odd numbers to n. Let me recall that odd numbers can be represented algebraically. The nth odd number is given by 2n - 1. For example, when n=1, 2(1)-1=1; when n=2, 2(2)-1=3, and so on. So, the first n odd numbers can be written as 1, 3, 5, ..., 2n-1.

Now, the sum of the first n odd numbers is S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1). I need to find a closed-form expression for S, which should be n squared. To do this, maybe I can use a mathematical induction approach or find a formula for S directly.

Let me try mathematical induction. The steps are usually: base case, inductive hypothesis, and inductive step. For the base case, when n=1, S=1, and 1 squared is 1, so the formula holds. Now, let's assume that for some integer k ≥ 1, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared. So, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k². That's our inductive hypothesis.

Now, let's consider the case for n = k + 1. The sum becomes the first k odd numbers plus the (k+1)th odd number. According to our inductive hypothesis, the first k odd numbers sum up to k squared. The (k+1)th odd number is 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1. So, the total sum S for n = k + 1 is k² + (2k + 1). Let's compute that: k² + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)². Because k² + 2k + 1 factors into (k + 1)², which is the square of n (since n = k +1). So, the inductive step holds.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n². That seems solid. But wait, maybe there's another way to think about this without using induction? Perhaps by pairing terms or using some sort of summation formula. Let's explore that.

Another approach: let's think of the odd numbers as spaced by 2. So, starting at 1, each next odd number is 2 more than the previous one. So, the sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 2n -1. I wonder if there's a way to find the average of these terms and multiply by the number of terms to get the sum.

The average of the first n odd numbers could be the midpoint of the sequence. Since they're evenly spaced, the average is simply the middle term, which would be the nth term. So, the average is (2n - 1). Wait, that doesn't seem right because for n=3, the terms are 1,3,5, their average is 3, which is the second term, not the third. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up here.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the sum as two separate sums. Wait, no, each term is being added as is. Maybe I can represent each term as (2k - 1) and sum them up. So, S = sum_{k=1 to n} (2k - 1). Let's split the sum: S = 2 sum_{k=1 to n} k - sum_{k=1 to n} 1.

Now, sum_{k=1 to n} k is the well-known formula n(n +1)/2, and sum_{k=1 to n} 1 is just n. So, S = 2*(n(n +1)/2) - n = n(n +1) - n = n² + n - n = n². Wow, that's a straightforward algebraic proof without induction. That's cool.

So, there are two methods to prove this: induction and algebraic manipulation. Both lead to the same conclusion that the sum is n squared. I think both are valid and complete. Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe think about this geometrically. An odd number can be thought of as a line of squares, and the sum of such lines up to n would form a square structure.

For example, when you add the first odd number, you have a single square. Adding the second odd number, you're effectively adding a row and a column to make a 2x2 square. Then adding the third odd number, you build up to a 3x3 square, and so on. This visual representation helps solidify the idea that the sum of the first n odd numbers forms a square with side length n. That's another way to understand why the sum equals n squared.

In summary, I've approached this problem using mathematical induction, algebraic summation, and geometric visualization. All methods lead to the same result: the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared. This gives me confidence in the correctness of the proof. I think I've covered all the angles, so I'm ready to present the formal proof step-by-step.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use both mathematical induction and algebraic manipulation. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers. The odd numbers are given by the sequence \( 1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, 2n - 1 \). Our goal is to show that the sum of these numbers equals \( n^2 \).

**Step 2: Mathematical Induction**

**Base Case:**
For \( n = 1 \):
\[
\text{Sum} = 1 = 1^2 = 1
\]
The base case holds.

**Inductive Hypothesis:**
Assume that the statement is true for some integer \( k \geq 1 \):
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) = k^2
\]

**Inductive Step:**
We need to show that the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \):
\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1)
\]
Using the inductive hypothesis:
\[
= k^2 + (2k + 1)
\]
Simplify:
\[
= k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
\]
Thus, the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \).

By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

**Step 3: Algebraic Manipulation**

The \( n \)-th odd number is \( 2n - 1 \). The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) odd numbers is:
\[
S = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n} k - \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1
\]
We know that:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]
and
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 = n
\]
Substitute these into the equation:
\[
S = 2 \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right) - n = n(n + 1) - n = n^2 + n - n = n^2
\]
Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).

**Step 4: Geometric Interpretation**

Odd numbers can be visualized as building up a square. The first odd number \( 1 \) is a 1x1 square. Adding the second odd number \( 3 \) forms a 2x2 square. Adding the third odd number \( 5 \) forms a 3x3 square, and so on. Each step adds a layer of odd numbers to form a larger square, resulting in the total sum being \( n^2 \).

**Conclusion**

Both mathematical induction and algebraic manipulation confirm that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \). Additionally, the geometric interpretation provides intuitive understanding of why this relationship holds. Therefore, we have rigorously proven that:
\[
1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n - 1) = n^2
