Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I have to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First off, what exactly are the first n odd natural numbers? Well, odd natural numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. The first one is 1, the second is 3, the third is 5, and so on. So, if we take the first n of these numbers, the sequence would be 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the nth odd number. I think I remember that the nth odd number can be represented by the formula 2n - 1. Let me check that: for n=1, 2(1)-1=1, which is correct. For n=2, 2(2)-1=3, and so on. Yep, that seems right.

So, the first n odd numbers can be written as 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n - 1). Now, I need to find the sum of these numbers. The problem says it's supposed to be equal to n squared, so the sum S should be equal to n². Let me write that down:

S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n²

Okay, how do I approach this? Maybe I can try writing out the sum for small values of n and see if the pattern holds.

Let's try n=1: sum is 1. n²=1. That's equal.

n=2: 1 + 3 = 4. 2²=4. Equal.

n=3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. 3²=9. Equal.

n=4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. 4²=16. Equal.

Okay, the formula seems to hold for these small values. But how do I prove it for any n? Maybe I can use mathematical induction since this is a statement that can be proven using that method.

Mathematical induction involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. 

Base case: Show that the statement is true for the first value, which is n=1. 

We already did that: for n=1, the sum is 1, which equals 1²=1. So, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, meaning that the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is k². Then, show that this implies the statement is true for k+1, that is, the sum of the first k+1 odd natural numbers is (k+1)².

So, let's assume that for n=k, the sum is k²:

S_k = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k²

Now, we need to show that S_{k+1} = (k+1)². To find S_{k+1}, we take S_k and add the next odd number, which is 2(k+1) -1 = 2k + 2 -1 = 2k +1.

So, S_{k+1} = S_k + (2k + 1) = k² + (2k +1)

Now, let's compute k² + 2k +1:

k² + 2k +1 = (k + 1)²

Because (k +1)² expands to k² + 2k +1. 

Therefore, S_{k+1} = (k+1)²

This completes the inductive step. 

Since both the base case and the inductive step hold, by mathematical induction, the statement S = n² is true for all natural numbers n.

Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series? Because the odd numbers form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.

The general formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:

S = n/2 * [2a + (n -1)d]

where:
- n is the number of terms,
- a is the first term,
- d is the common difference.

In our case, the first term a is 1, and the common difference d is 2. Plugging these into the formula:

S = n/2 * [2(1) + (n -1)(2)]
Simplify:
S = n/2 * [2 + 2(n -1)]
Simplify inside the brackets:
2 + 2n - 2 = 2n
So:
S = n/2 * 2n = n²

Perfect, that gives the same result. So, using the arithmetic series formula also confirms the sum is n².

Alternatively, maybe I can think about pairing the terms. For example, in the sum S =1 +3+5+...+(2n-1), if I pair the first and last terms, I get 1 + (2n -1) = 2n. Then, the second and second-to-last terms give 3 + (2n -3) = 2n. Continuing this way, each pair sums to 2n. How many such pairs are there? For n terms, there are n/2 pairs, since each pair consists of two numbers. Therefore, the total sum would be (n/2) * 2n = n².

That's another way to see it. It seems consistent across different methods.

Is there a formula for the sum of consecutive odd numbers? Wait, I just recalled that the sum of the first n odd numbers is actually a square. Yes, this is exactly what the problem is about. The formula S = n² comes from the fact that when you arrange n odd numbers in a square, they perfectly fit into that n x n square. 

But to visualize it, maybe arranging them in a grid can help. If you lay out 1 square, then a 3x3 square, then a 5x5, etc., each layer adds an odd number of squares, and the total is always a square number. That’s an interesting geometric interpretation.

So, putting it all together, I've used mathematical induction, the arithmetic series formula, and a pairing method to confirm that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n². Each approach reinforces the same conclusion, so I feel confident that the proof is solid.

Maybe another way to think about it is through programming. If I have a function that iterates n times, adding the current odd number each time, the result should be n squared. Let's see, for example, in Python:

def sum_odds(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        total += (2*i -1)
    return total

Testing this for n=1,2,3,4 as before, all return n squared. So, computationally, it also holds.

All right, I think I've covered several different angles to prove this. From algebraic manipulation and induction to pairing and geometric visualization. All leading to the same result that the sum is n squared. So, I'm pretty certain that the proof is correct.
</think>

The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Here's a step-by-step proof:

**Proof by Mathematical Induction:**

1. **Base Case (n=1):**
   - The sum of the first 1 odd natural number is 1.
   - 1 squared is 1.
   - Therefore, the statement holds for n=1.

2. **Inductive Step:**
   - Assume the statement is true for some positive integer k, i.e.,
     \[
     S_k = 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) = k^2
     \]
   - We need to show that the statement is true for k+1, i.e.,
     \[
     S_{k+1} = S_k + (2(k+1) - 1) = (k+1)^2
     \]
   - Starting from the left side:
     \[
     S_{k+1} = S_k + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
     \]
   - Thus, if the statement holds for k, it also holds for k+1.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared for all natural numbers n.

**Alternative Proof using the Arithmetic Series Formula:**

1. **Identify the Series:**
   - The first n odd natural numbers form an arithmetic sequence with:
     - First term \( a = 1 \)
     - Common difference \( d = 2 \)

2. **Arithmetic Series Sum Formula:**
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a + (n - 1)d]
   \]

3. **Substitute Values:**
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2(1) + (n - 1)(2)] = \frac{n}{2} [2 + 2n - 2] = \frac{n}{2} [2n] = n^2
   \]

**Conclusion:**

Both methods confirm that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
