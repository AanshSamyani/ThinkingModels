Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, where do I start with? Maybe I can look at some examples to get a feel for what's going on.

Let me list the first few odd natural numbers and see what their sum looks like.

1 is the first odd natural number. Its sum is just 1.

1 + 3 = 4.

1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16.

Wait a minute, those sums are 1, 4, 9, 16... That looks familiar, like squares of 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. So, is the sum of the first n odd numbers equal to n squared? That seems to be the pattern. But how do I prove that?

Maybe I can think about what an odd number is. An odd number is any integer that can be written as 2k + 1, where k is a non-negative integer. So, the first odd number is when k=0: 2*0 +1 = 1, the second is 3, which is 2*1 +1, then 5 is 2*2 +1, and so on.

So the first n odd numbers are: 1, 3, 5, ..., up to (2n - 1). Because when k = n-1, the number is 2*(n-1) +1 = 2n -2 +1 = 2n -1.

So, the sum S is 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n -1). I need to prove that S = n^2.

I've seen proofs before where the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared. Maybe I can think about this in terms of blocks or visualize it.

Perhaps an induction approach would work. Let's try mathematical induction.

Base case: n=1. Sum is 1, and 1^2=1. So it holds.

Assume it holds for some n=k: that the sum of the first k odd numbers is k^2.

Now, we need to show that the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers is (k+1)^2.

The (k+1)-th odd number is (2k +1). So, the sum would be k^2 + (2k +1) = k^2 + 2k +1 = (k +1)^2.

Yes, that works.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the sum as forming a square. Let me try visualizing it.

Imagine building a square with n by n blocks. Each layer adds an odd number of blocks. For instance:

- 1x1 square: 1 block. That's the first odd number.

- 2x2 square: 1 + 3 = 4 blocks. So adding 3 blocks.

- 3x3 square: 4 +5=9 blocks. Adding 5 blocks.

Each time you add the next odd number, you're completing a larger square. So, the total number of blocks is the area of the square, which is n squared.

But this is more of an intuitive explanation. Maybe I can make it more mathematical.

Another way to think about it is using sequences. The odd numbers are an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 2. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + (n-1)*2 = 2n -1. As I figured before.

So, the sum S = sum_{k=1 to n} (2k -1) = 2 sum_{k=1 to n} k - sum_{k=1 to n}1.

I know that sum_{k=1 to n}k is n(n+1)/2. And sum_{k=1 to n}1 is n.

So plugging that in:

S = 2*(n(n+1)/2) - n = n(n+1) -n = n^2 +n -n = n^2.

That's another way to see it.

But I want to make sure I understand each step clearly.

First, I express the odd numbers as 2k -1. Then, I sum them from k=1 to n.

So, sum_{k=1 to n} (2k -1) = 2*sum_{k=1 to n}k - sum_{k=1 to n}1.

That's a standard property of summations: sum (a*k + b) = a*sum k + b*sum 1, where a and b are constants.

So, applying this, we have 2 times sum from 1 to n of k minus sum from 1 to n of 1.

I remember that sum from 1 to n of k is n(n+1)/2. Let me verify that.

Sum from 1 to n is n*(n +1)/2. That's a well-known formula.

Sum from 1 to n of 1 is simply n, because you're adding 1, n times.

So substituting back:

S = 2*(n(n+1)/2) -n.

The 2 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:

2*(n(n+1)/2) = n(n+1)

Then subtract n: n(n+1) -n =n^2 +n -n =n^2.

Yes, that simplifies to n squared. Therefore, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared.

I think I've covered this with mathematical induction, an intuitive visualization, and a direct algebraic computation. All methods lead to the same conclusion. I can be confident that the sum is indeed n squared.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to \boxed{n^2}.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use several methods including mathematical induction, an intuitive visualization, and direct algebraic computation.

First, consider the sequence of odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., up to \( 2n - 1 \). We need to show that the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is \( n^2 \).

### Mathematical Induction
1. **Base case**: For \( n = 1 \), the sum is 1, which is \( 1^2 \). Thus, the base case holds.
2. **Inductive step**: Assume the sum of the first \( k \) odd numbers is \( k^2 \). For \( n = k + 1 \), the sum becomes:
   \[
   k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
   \]
   Thus, the inductive step holds.

### Intuitive Visualization
Visualizing the sum of odd numbers as building a square, each layer adds an odd number of blocks, completing a larger square. This shows the total number of blocks is the area of the square, which is \( n^2 \).

### Direct Algebraic Computation
The \( k \)-th odd number is \( 2k - 1 \). The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n} k - \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1
\]
Using the formulas:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 = n
\]
Substitute these into the sum:
\[
2 \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right) - n = n(n+1) - n = n^2 + n - n = n^2
\]

Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \(\boxed{n^2}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
