Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.

Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, let's think about how these numbers look and maybe come up with a pattern or a formula.

First, what are the first few odd natural numbers? Well, odd numbers are numbers that aren't divisible by 2, so they start at 1 and then go 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. So the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. Let me write them down:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ...

Now, if I want the sum of these numbers up to the nth one, say up to 11, which is the 6th odd number, the sum should be 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11. Let me calculate that: 1 + 3 is 4, plus 5 is 9, plus 7 is 16, plus 9 is 25, plus 11 is 36. So the sum is 36, and n squared is 6² which is 36. Okay, that works.

Wait, is this always true? Let me try another example. Let's take n=3. The first three odd numbers are 1, 3, 5. Their sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. And 3² is also 9. Okay, still holds. Let's try n=1. Then the sum is just 1, which is 1². Hmm, that's also true. So it seems like this formula works in these cases.

But how can I prove it in general? Maybe by induction or using some formula.

I remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2, but this is about odd numbers. Let me think about how these odd numbers relate to the natural numbers.

Wait, I think there's a relationship between the odd numbers and the squares of natural numbers. Let me see: 1 is 1², 1 + 3 is 4, which is 2², 1 + 3 + 5 is 9, which is 3², and so on. That seems to be the case.

So, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared. Now, how can I express the sum of the first n odd numbers?

Let me think: the kth odd number is 2k - 1. So, the first n odd numbers are:

1st: 2*1 - 1 = 1

2nd: 2*2 - 1 = 3

3rd: 2*3 - 1 = 5

...

nth: 2n - 1

Therefore, the sum of the first n odd numbers is:

Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1)

Hmm, maybe I can find a formula for this sum. Let me try to use the method of mathematical induction.

First, let's check the base case, n=1. Sum = 1, which equals 1² = 1. So, base case holds.

Now, suppose that for some integer k >= 1, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k². That is,

Sum_{i=1 to k} (2i - 1) = k²

Now, I need to prove that Sum_{i=1 to k+1} (2i - 1) = (k+1)²

So, Sum_{i=1 to k+1} (2i - 1) = Sum_{i=1 to k} (2i - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1)

Using the induction hypothesis, the first part is k², so:

Sum = k² + (2(k+1) - 1) = k² + (2k + 2 - 1) = k² + 2k + 1

Which simplifies to:

(k + 1)²

Which is the desired result. Therefore, by induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared.

Wait, but I could have thought about this another way. Since the nth odd number is 2n - 1, and each odd number can be thought of as 1 more than an even number, like 2(n-1) + 1 = 2n - 1.

But that might complicate things. The induction approach seems straightforward.

Alternatively, I could think of the sum of the first n odd numbers as a telescoping series or use another formula.

Wait, another formula for the sum is Sum_{k=1 to n} (2k - 1) = 2*Sum_{k=1 to n}k - Sum_{k=1 to n}1.

Which is 2*(n(n + 1)/2) - n = n(n + 1) - n = n² + n - n = n².

So that's another way to derive it. So, both methods give me the same result.

So, in conclusion, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed equal to n squared.
</think>

The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers can be proven to be equal to \( n^2 \) using mathematical induction.

**Base Case:**
For \( n = 1 \), the first odd number is 1. Thus,
\[ 1 = 1^2 \]
The base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that the statement holds for some integer \( k \), i.e.,
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{k} (2i - 1) = k^2 \]

We need to show that:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} (2i - 1) = (k+1)^2 \]

Starting with the left-hand side:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} (2i - 1) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (2i - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1) \]
Using the induction hypothesis:
\[ = k^2 + (2k + 2 - 1) \]
\[ = k^2 + 2k + 1 \]
\[ = (k + 1)^2 \]

Thus, the statement holds for \( k + 1 \).

By the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).
