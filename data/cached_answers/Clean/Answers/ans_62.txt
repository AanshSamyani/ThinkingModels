Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I have this problem to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, that sounds interesting. I remember learning about sequences and series, so maybe I can use that to tackle this problem. Let me think about how to approach it step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly the problem is asking. It says the sum of the first n odd natural numbers. So, if n is, say, 1, then the sum should be 1. If n is 2, then it's 1 + 3 = 4, and so on. Let me list out some examples to get a sense of the pattern.

- For n=1: Sum = 1 (which is 1²)
- For n=2: Sum = 1 + 3 = 4 (which is 2²)
- For n=3: Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 (which is 3²)
- For n=4: Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 (which is 4²)
- For n=5: Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25 (which is 5²)

Hmm, so far, all these examples work perfectly. It seems like there's a pattern here. The sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared. But how can I prove this in general? I need to find a systematic way to show that regardless of the value of n, the sum will always equal n squared.

Let me think about sequences and series. I remember that arithmetic sequences have a common difference, and this case seems to fit that. The odd natural numbers increase by 2 each time, so it is indeed an arithmetic sequence with the first term a₁ = 1 and common difference d = 2.

The general formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is Sₙ = n/2 * [2a₁ + (n - 1)d]. Let me plug in the values I have here.

So, Sₙ = n/2 * [2(1) + (n - 1)(2)] = n/2 * [2 + 2n - 2] = n/2 * [2n] = n/2 * 2n = n²

Oh, wait a minute! That worked out perfectly. So, by applying the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, I was able to derive that Sₙ equals n squared. That seems like a solid proof, but I want to make sure I understand each step clearly.

Let me go through it again to double-check. The first term a₁ is 1, the common difference d is 2. So, the terms of the sequence are 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., and so on. To find the sum of the first n terms, I use the formula:

Sₙ = n/2 * [2a₁ + (n - 1)d]

Substituting the values:

= n/2 * [2(1) + (n - 1)(2)]
= n/2 * [2 + 2n - 2]
= n/2 * [2n]
= n²

Yes, it all adds up. So, this formula works for arithmetic sequences where the difference is 2 and the first term is 1, which perfectly fits our case of odd natural numbers.

Is there another way to think about this without using the arithmetic series formula? Maybe by induction or using induction on n? Let me consider both approaches.

First, using mathematical induction as a separate method.

**Base Case (n=1):**

For n=1, the sum is 1, and 1² = 1. So, the statement holds for n=1.

**Inductive Step:**

Assume that the statement holds for some integer k, meaning that the sum of the first k odd numbers is k².

Now, I need to show that the sum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers is (k + 1)².

Let's denote S_k as the sum of the first k odd numbers, so S_k = k².

The next odd number after the kth term would be 2k + 1. So, the sum up to the (k + 1)th term is S_k + (2k + 1) = k² + 2k + 1.

But k² + 2k + 1 is equal to (k + 1)².

Therefore, the statement holds for n = k + 1.

Since both the base case and inductive step have been verified, by mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.

Alright, that also works. So, either using the arithmetic series formula or mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n squared.

Wait, just to make sure I'm thorough, is there any case or scenario where this might not hold? Let me think.

Well, the first n odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n - 1). Each of these numbers is natural and odd, so they exist for any positive integer n. The formula Sₙ = n² is a well-established identity in mathematics, so I don't think I need to worry about the validity in any specific context beyond the natural numbers and positive integers.

Also, plugging in more examples to test this further. Let me try n=6:

Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36 (which is 6²). Yep, that works.

Similarly, n=7: 1+3+5+7+9+11+13=49 (7²). Perfect.

So, all test cases align with the conclusion. I think I have a solid proof here. Both the direct arithmetic series approach and the inductive method confirm that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed equal to n squared.

Is there another perspective or method someone might use to arrive at this proof? Maybe using geometry or some other kind of visualization?

Oh, right! I've heard of the visual proof where you arrange squares or something like that. Let me recall how that goes.

Imagine building squares with dots. The first odd number, 1, is just a single dot. The second odd number, 3, is a 2x2 square missing one dot. Hmm, actually, maybe that's not the best way. Alternatively, arranging numbers in a square grid.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about arranging the odd numbers in a diagonal or in a square pattern. But I might be mixing up with something else. I think the arithmetic series method is more straightforward and easier to follow without needing to visualize squares or anything like that.

So, I'll stick with the arithmetic series formula and the induction proof for clarity and simplicity.

In summary, whether using the arithmetic series formula or mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers equals n squared. Each step checks out, and the examples I've tried support the conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that this proof is valid and correct.

To prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use both the arithmetic series formula and mathematical induction.

**Arithmetic Series Approach:**

1. **Identify the sequence:**
   - The first n odd natural numbers form an arithmetic sequence with:
     - First term (\( a_1 \)) = 1
     - Common difference (\( d \)) = 2

2. **Formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence:**
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left[ 2a_1 + (n - 1)d \right]
   \]

3. **Substitute the values:**
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left[ 2(1) + (n - 1)(2) \right] = \frac{n}{2} \left[ 2 + 2n - 2 \right] = \frac{n}{2} \left[ 2n \right] = n^2
   \]

**Mathematical Induction:**

1. **Base Case (n=1):**
   - Sum = 1
   - \( 1^2 = 1 \)
   - The base case holds true.

2. **Inductive Step:**
   - Assume the statement is true for \( n = k \), i.e., the sum of the first \( k \) odd numbers is \( k^2 \).
   - We need to show that the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 \).
   - The next odd number after the \( k \)th term is \( 2k + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the sum becomes:
     \[
     k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
     \]
   - Thus, if the statement holds for \( n = k \), it also holds for \( n = k + 1 \).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers \( n \).

Therefore, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).
