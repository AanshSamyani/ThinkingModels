Okay, let me try to figure out this problem where I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. Hmm, where do I start? I remember that odd numbers are like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, the first n odd numbers would be 1, 3, 5, … up to the nth odd number. Maybe I can list them out for some small n to see if there's a pattern.

Let's try n=1: The first odd number is 1. The sum is 1. And 1 squared is 1. That matches. Okay, n=2: The first two odd numbers are 1 and 3. Their sum is 1+3=4. And 2 squared is 4. Still good. Let's try n=3: 1+3+5=9. 3 squared is 9. Still matching! Hmm, seems like it works for the first few numbers. But how do I prove it for any n? Maybe there's a formula for the sum of odd numbers?

I think the nth odd number can be represented as 2n-1. Wait, let me check: For n=1, 2(1)-1=1. That's correct. For n=2, 2(2)-1=3. Yes, that works. So the nth odd number is 2n-1. Therefore, the sum of the first n odd numbers would be the sum from k=1 to n of (2k-1). So, Sum = sum_{k=1 to n} (2k -1). I can split this sum into two parts: Sum = 2*sum_{k=1 to n}k - sum_{k=1 to n}1.

Now, I know that sum_{k=1 to n}k is equal to n(n+1)/2. And sum_{k=1 to n}1 is just n. So substituting these back in: Sum = 2*(n(n+1)/2) - n. Simplify that: 2*(n(n+1)/2) simplifies to n(n+1). Then, subtract n: Sum = n(n+1) - n = n^2 + n - n = n^2. So, it simplifies to n squared.

Wait, so that's the proof? Let me go through it again. I represented the nth odd number as 2n-1, summed them up from k=1 to n, and used the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. That worked out to n squared. Does this hold for all n? Let's test it for n=4: 1+3+5+7=16, and 4^2=16. Yep, seems consistent.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me think about a different approach. Maybe induction? If I use mathematical induction, I can prove this statement holds for all natural numbers. 

Base case: n=1. As before, the sum is 1, which equals 1 squared. So, the base case holds.

Assume that for some integer k ≥1, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared. That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k -1) = k^2.

Now, I need to show that the sum of the first k+1 odd numbers is (k+1)^2. So, the sum would be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1). By the induction hypothesis, the first k terms sum to k squared. Then, adding the (k+1)th odd number, which is 2(k+1)-1=2k+1. So, the total sum is k^2 + (2k+1). Let's compute that: k^2 + 2k +1 = (k+1)^2. Which is exactly what we needed to prove. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n.

So, both the direct algebraic proof and the induction method confirm that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is indeed n squared. I feel confident now that this is a valid proof.

The sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \).

**Proof:**

Let’s denote the \( n \) odd natural numbers as \( 1, 3, 5, \ldots, (2n-1) \). The sum \( S \) of these numbers can be written as:

\[
S = 1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n - 1)
\]

This can be expressed as the summation:

\[
S = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)
\]

Expanding this sum:

\[
S = 2\sum_{k=1}^{n} k - \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1
\]

We know the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

And the sum of \( n \) ones:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 = n
\]

Substituting these into the expression for \( S \):

\[
S = 2 \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right) - n
\]
\[
S = n(n + 1) - n
\]
\[
S = n^2 + n - n
\]
\[
S = n^2
\]

Thus, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
