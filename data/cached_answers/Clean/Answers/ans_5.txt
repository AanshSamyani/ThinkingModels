Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared, which is n². Hmm, where do I start with? I remember that odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, each increasing by 2. So the sequence of odd numbers starts at 1, then 3, then 5, and so on up to the nth odd number.

Let me write this out to make it clearer. The first odd natural number is 1, the second is 3, the third is 5, the fourth is 7, and so on. So, the nth odd number would be something like 2n - 1, right? Let's test that: if n is 1, 2(1) - 1 = 1, which is correct. If n is 2, 2(2) - 1 = 3, which is also correct. So, in general, the nth odd natural number is 2n - 1.

Now, I need to find the sum of the first n odd numbers. So that would be adding up all the odd numbers from the first one up to the nth one. So, if I list them out: 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., (2n - 1). I have to add all of these together and show that their sum equals n squared.

Let me try an example first to get a feel for it. Let's take n = 3. The first three odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. Their sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. And 3 squared is 9. So, it works for n=3. Let me try n=4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. And 4 squared is 16. So that works too.

But examples don't prove anything, right? I need a general proof. Maybe induction? I've heard of induction before. It's a method of proving statements are true for all natural numbers.

Alright, so let's recall how mathematical induction works. There are two steps: the base case and the inductive step.

First, the base case: show that the statement is true for n = 1. Then, assuming it's true for some arbitrary natural number k, show that it must also be true for n = k + 1.

Let me start with the base case. For n=1, the first odd number is 1. The sum is 1, which is 1 squared, so that checks out.

Now, the inductive step. Let's assume that the statement is true for n=k. That is, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k squared. So, by assumption, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k².

Now, I need to show that the statement is true for n=k+1. That is, the sum of the first (k+1) odd numbers should be (k+1) squared.

The sum of the first (k+1) odd numbers is the sum of the first k odd numbers plus the (k+1)th odd number. So, that would be k² + (2(k+1) - 1).

Let me simplify that: 2(k+1) -1 = 2k + 2 -1 = 2k +1.

So, the sum is k² + (2k + 1) = k² + 2k +1.

Wait, k squared plus 2k plus 1 is equal to (k+1) squared, right? Because (k+1)^2 = k^2 + 2k +1.

Yes, so the sum of the first (k+1) odd numbers is (k+1) squared, which is exactly what we wanted to prove in the inductive step.

So, by mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.

Alternatively, I remember there is another way to think about this. Maybe by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

Let me recall that an arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the preceding term. In this case, the odd numbers form an arithmetic series with the first term a =1 and the common difference d=2.

The formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is S_n = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d].

Let's plug in the values: a=1, d=2.

So, S_n = n/2 * [2(1) + (n-1)(2)] = n/2 * [2 + 2n -2] = n/2 * [2n] = n/2 *2n =n *n =n².

That's a neat way to think about it, using the arithmetic series formula.

Wait, but maybe I can explain that formula to myself in a different way, just to solidify my understanding.

The arithmetic series formula: Sum = number of terms/2 multiplied by (first term + last term). So, Sum = n/2 * (1 + (2n -1)).

Simplify 1 + (2n -1) =1 +2n -1 =2n.

So, Sum =n/2 * 2n =n *n =n².

That also gives the same result, which confirms the identity.

Wait, but another thought: is there a way to visualize this? Like, maybe stacking numbers or something?

Hmm, maybe not necessary, but thinking about geometric representations sometimes helps. But since I already have two different proofs confirming that the sum equals n squared, I think that's sufficient.

Alternatively, another method is to pair terms in the series. Let's take the sum of the first n odd numbers: 1 +3 +5 +...+ (2n-1).

If I pair the first and last terms, the second and second last terms, etc., I can see what happens. For example, when n=3: 1 +3 +5 =9.

Grouped as (1+5) +3 =6 +3=9.

Similarly, for n=4:1 +3 +5 +7=16.

Grouped as (1+7)+(3+5)=8 +8=16.

So, in general, when you pair the first and last terms, you get a constant sum. The sum of each pair is (2k -1) + (2(n -k) +1) =2k -1 +2n -2k +1=2n.

There are n/2 such pairs. Wait, but when n is even, n/2 pairs, but when n is odd, perhaps n-1 is even?

Wait, actually, in this example, for n=4, I had two pairs, each summing to 8, so 2 *8=16, which is 4 squared.

Similarly, for n=3, 1+5=6, which is one pair, and then plus3, so it's not exactly straightforward.

But let's think for even n. Let me take n=2:1+3=4=2 squared.

n=2, pairs: (1+3)=4=2 squared. So, okay.

For n=4: as above, we have two pairs each summing to 8, so total 16=4 squared.

Wait, each pair sums to 2n. So, if n is even, like n=4, you can have n/2 pairs each summing to 2n? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, in n=4, 2n=8, and we have 2 pairs, each summing to8, so that's indeed 2*(2n)=4n, but for n=4, 2*(8)=16, which is equal to n². Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, if I see each pair of (1+3)=4, (5+7)=12, (9+11)=20, etc. Wait, not sure that helps.

But perhaps the pairing idea, even if a bit convoluted, shows that the sum can be grouped into equal parts, each part equal to a multiple of n, but maybe it's not necessary.

Anyway, since we've already got two proofs using induction and the arithmetic series formula, I think that's sufficient.

So, to recap:

1. Base case: n=1, sum=1=1².

2. Inductive step: Assume sum of first k odd numbers is k², then sum of first k+1 is k² + (2(k+1)-1) =k² +2k +1= (k+1)².

3. Arithmetic series formula: n/2 [2a + (n-1)d] gives Sum=n/2 [2*1 + (n-1)*2]=n/2*(2 +2n-2)=n/2*2n=n².

Hence, proven for all natural numbers n.

I think that's thorough enough. Maybe I can explain it a bit differently to myself, but in terms of the initial thought process, I can see how I could start with testing small cases, then think about generalizing it, then formalize the approach with induction, and finally use an arithmetic series formula.

Alternatively, since the problem seems simple, but understanding different proof techniques like mathematical induction is useful for more complex problems.

Another angle could be to use visual representations or geometric interpretations, but since I already have two algebraic proofs, maybe that's enough.

I guess another way to think about it is to realize that the sum of the first n odd numbers creates a square grid or something, but I think that's complicating things.

In any case, I feel confident now that the sum of the first n odd numbers is indeed n squared by using mathematical induction and the arithmetic series formula.

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction.

**Step 1: Base Case**

For \( n = 1 \):
The first odd natural number is 1.
\[ \text{Sum} = 1 \]
\[ 1^2 = 1 \]
Thus, the base case holds.

**Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**

Assume that for some arbitrary positive integer \( k \), the sum of the first \( k \) odd natural numbers is \( k^2 \). That is,
\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) = k^2 \]

**Step 3: Inductive Step**

We need to show that the sum of the first \( k + 1 \) odd natural numbers is \( (k + 1)^2 \).
\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = k^2 + (2k + 1) \]
Simplify the right side:
\[ k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2 \]
Thus, the inductive step holds.

**Conclusion**

By mathematical induction, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).

Another algebraic proof using the arithmetic series formula:
The first \( n \) odd numbers form an arithmetic series with:
- First term \( a = 1 \)
- Common difference \( d = 2 \)

The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a + (n - 1)d] \]
Substitute the values:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2(1) + (n - 1)(2)] = \frac{n}{2} (2 + 2n - 2) = \frac{n}{2} (2n) = n^2 \]

Hence, the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is \( n^2 \).
