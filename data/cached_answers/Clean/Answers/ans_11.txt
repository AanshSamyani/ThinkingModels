Prove that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is equal to n^2.
<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to prove that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is equal to n squared. I remember that odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. 

Let me start by writing down what the first few sums look like for small values of n to see if I can spot a pattern. 

When n=1:
The sum is just 1. So 1² = 1. That matches.

When n=2:
The sum is 1 + 3 = 4. And 2² is also 4. Still matching.

When n=3:
Sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. 3² is 9. Again, it matches.

Let me try n=4:
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. 4² is 16. Still holds up.

So, empirically, it seems to be true for these small values. But I need a general proof. Hmm, how can I approach this?

Maybe induction is a good method. Induction involves proving the base case and then showing that if it holds for one number, it holds for the next. 

So let's try mathematical induction.

**Base Case:**
n=1: Sum =1, 1²=1. So, it works for n=1.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, meaning that:
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k².

Now, I need to show that the statement is also true for k+1, which means:
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2k+1) = (k+1)².

Starting from the assumption:
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k².

Adding the next odd number, which is 2k+1, to both sides:
k² + (2k+1) = (k+1)².

Let's simplify the left side:
k² + 2k + 1 = (k+1)².

Which is the same as the right side. So, the equality holds.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did the inductive step correctly. Let me write it again to make sure.

Assume true for n=k:
Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k².

Now, for n=k+1:
Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2k+1) = Sum + (2k+1) = k² + (2k+1).

Simplify k² + 2k +1 = (k+1)². Yes, that's correct.

So, induction works and the statement is proven.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of another way to see why this is true, perhaps using a formula or rearranging terms.

Another idea: The average of the numbers times the number of terms.

The first term is 1, the last term is 2n-1 (since the nth odd number is 2n-1). So, the average is (1 + (2n-1))/2 = (2n)/2 = n.

So, average * number of terms = n * n = n². That's another way to see it.

I guess both the induction method and considering the average of the sequence give the same result.

Wait, maybe using formulas for arithmetic series could be helpful too.

An arithmetic series where the first term is a1=1, the common difference d=2, and the nth term an = 2n -1.

The sum of an arithmetic series is n*(a1 + an)/2 = n*(1 + (2n -1))/2 = n*(2n)/2 = n².

Yes, that's a concise way to express it.

So, altogether, there are a few different approaches: using induction with the assumption, using the average of the sequence, or applying the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. All of them lead to the same conclusion that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared.

I think I'm confident now that the proof is solid and all paths converge to n².
</think>

To prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is equal to \( n^2 \), we can use mathematical induction, the concept of arithmetic series averages, or other algebraic methods. Here's a step-by-step explanation using induction and the arithmetic series formula.

**Proof Using Mathematical Induction:**

1. **Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
   - The first odd natural number is 1.
   - Sum = 1
   - \( 1^2 = 1 \)
   - Thus, the statement holds for \( n = 1 \).

2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**
   - Assume the statement is true for some positive integer \( k \), i.e.,
     \[
     1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) = k^2
     \]

3. **Inductive Step (\( n = k + 1 \)):**
   - We need to show that:
     \[
     1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2
     \]
   - Using the inductive hypothesis:
     \[
     k^2 + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)^2
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
     \]
   - Since \( (k + 1)^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 \), the equation holds.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \( n \).

**Proof Using Arithmetic Series:**

1. **Identify the Arithmetic Series:**
   - The first term \( a = 1 \), common difference \( d = 2 \), and the nth term \( a_n = 2n - 1 \).

2. **Sum of First \( n \) Terms:**
   - The sum \( S \) of an arithmetic series is given by:
     \[
     S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     S = \frac{n}{2} \times (1 + (2n - 1)) = \frac{n}{2} \times (2n) = n^2
     \]

**Conclusion:**

Both methods confirm that the sum of the first \( n \) odd natural numbers is indeed \( n^2 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
