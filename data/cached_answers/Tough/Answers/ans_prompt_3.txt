It seems you've pasted a complete problem and its context. Let me help you with it step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
"A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter is 48 cm, what are the dimensions?"

**Solution:**

Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \) cm.

Given that the length (\( l \)) is 3 times the width:
\[ l = 3w \]

The formula for the perimeter (\( P \)) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2l + 2w \]

We are given that the perimeter is 48 cm:
\[ 48 = 2l + 2w \]

Substitute \( l = 3w \) into the equation:
\[ 48 = 2(3w) + 2w \]
\[ 48 = 6w + 2w \]
\[ 48 = 8w \]

Now, solve for \( w \):
\[ w = \frac{48}{8} \]
\[ w = 6 \text{ cm} \]

Now, find the length using \( l = 3w \):
\[ l = 3 \times 6 \]
\[ l = 18 \text{ cm} \]

**Conclusion:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: \( 6 \text{ cm} \)
- Length: \( 18 \text{ cm} \)<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
