Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the dimensions of this rectangle where the length is twice its width, and the area is 50 square centimeters. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, I know that for rectangles, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, if I let the width be some number, say, \( w \), then the length would be twice that, which is \( 2w \). That makes sense because it says the length is twice the width.

Now, the area is given as 50 square centimeters. So, using the formula for area, which is length times width, I can write that as:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
Plugging in the expressions I have:
\[ 50 = 2w \times w \]
Wait, so that's \( 2w \times w \), which is the same as \( 2w^2 \). So, the equation becomes:
\[ 50 = 2w^2 \]
Okay, so now I need to solve for \( w \). Let me rewrite that equation:
\[ 2w^2 = 50 \]
To solve for \( w^2 \), I can divide both sides by 2:
\[ w^2 = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ w^2 = 25 \]
So, to find \( w \), I take the square root of both sides:
\[ w = \sqrt{25} \]
\[ w = 5 \]
Wait, since \( w \) represents a length, it can't be negative. So, we only take the positive value, which is 5 centimeters. That makes sense.

Now, the width is 5 cm, and the length is twice that, so:
\[ \text{Length} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cm} \]
Let me double-check my work. If the width is 5 cm and the length is 10 cm, multiplying them together gives:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ cm}^2 \]
Which matches the area given. So, that seems correct.

Just to recap, I let the width be \( w \), expressed the length in terms of \( w \), plugged into the area formula, solved the equation, and found both dimensions. Everything checks out, so I think I'm good.

I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using ratios or proportions. Hmm, another way could be to recognize that the ratio of length to width is 2:1. If the area is 50, maybe we can think of the length and width as parts of a whole in terms of the ratio.

Let me try that. If the ratio is 2:1, we can represent the length as 2 parts and the width as 1 part. So, in total, the rectangle is made up of 3 parts. Each part would then be \( \frac{50}{3} \), but that would give us a fractional dimension, which isn't necessarily simpler. Wait, maybe not the best approach because we end up with fractions which aren't as clean as whole numbers. So, perhaps the initial method is more straightforward.

Alternatively, if I didn't use algebra, could I use some kind of trial and error? Let's see. If the width were 4 cm, the length would be 8 cm, and the area would be 32 cm², which is less than 50. If the width were 5 cm, the length is 10 cm, and the area is exactly 50. If I tried 6 cm, the area would be 6*12=72 cm², which is more than 50. So, that's another way to verify: 5 cm and 10 cm work.

This makes me feel confident that 5 cm and 10 cm are the correct dimensions for the rectangle.

I also recall that sometimes, in geometry, you can represent variables using other letters to avoid confusion. But in this case, it's pretty straightforward, so using width and length seems appropriate.

Another thing that comes to mind is whether the units are consistent. The area is given in square centimeters, which implies that both length and width are in centimeters. So, as long as my dimensions are also in centimeters, everything should be fine.

Is there any chance I might have made a mistake in setting up the equation? Let me look back. I set width as \( w \), length as \( 2w \), area as \( 2w^2 \). Then, solving \( 2w^2 = 50 \), gives \( w = 5 \). That seems correct.

Wait, could I have confused length and width somewhere? No, the problem clearly states the length is twice the width, so if the width is 5 cm, the length is 10 cm. So, the dimensions are correctly assigned.

I suppose another way to think about it is to imagine the rectangle as fitting into a grid where each square is 1 cm². So, an area of 50 cm² means the rectangle covers 50 such squares. If the length is twice the width, it's kind of like the rectangle is twice as long as it is wide.

Let me also consider the concept of square roots for a moment. Since \( w^2 = 25 \), and the square root of 25 is 5, which gives the width. This is a common technique in solving quadratic equations, where you take the square root of both sides to find the variable. That makes sense because squaring and square rooting are inverse operations, so they cancel each other out.

I wonder if this could be extended to other problems. Like, if the area of a rectangle is given, and the sides are in some ratio, then you can set variables based on the ratio and solve using the area formula. This is a general approach, not specific to rectangles, but works here.

Is there a possibility that the problem is referring to something else, like a square where both sides are related by a ratio? But no, the problem specifically mentions a rectangle, so unless it was a square, but in that case, if it was a square, then both length and width would be equal. But in our case, they are in a 2:1 ratio, so that's a rectangle, not a square.

Also, to make sure I didn't mess up the algebra, I can redo the steps. Starting from:
\[ 50 = 2w \times w \]
Simplify the right side:
\[ 50 = 2w^2 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 25 = w^2 \]
Take square root:
\[ w = 5 \]
That's the same result as before. No mistakes detected.

Let me think about units for a moment. The area is given in square centimeters, so each dimension should have the unit of centimeters. So, 5 cm and 10 cm are correct.

I suppose another check could be to compute the area with the obtained dimensions and see if it equals 50. As I did before, length 10 and width 5, so 10*5=50, yes, that's correct.

Hmm, I feel confident now. So, the rectangle has a width of 5 cm and a length of 10 cm, and that satisfies the given conditions: the length is twice the width, and the area is 50 square centimeters.

I don't think I missed anything here. It seems straightforward once I set up the variables properly.
</think>

The dimensions of the rectangle are as follows:

1. **Width**: 5 centimeters.
2. **Length**: 10 centimeters.

**Explanation:**

Let the width be \( w \) cm. Since the length is twice the width, the length is \( 2w \) cm.

The area of the rectangle is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 50 = 2w \times w \]
\[ 50 = 2w^2 \]

Solving for \( w \):
\[ 2w^2 = 50 \]
\[ w^2 = 25 \]
\[ w = 5 \] cm (since width cannot be negative)

Thus, the length is:
\[ 2w = 2 \times 5 = 10 \] cm

Checking the area:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ cm}^2 \] which matches the given area.

**Final Answer:**
- Width: 5 cm
- Length: 10 cm<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
