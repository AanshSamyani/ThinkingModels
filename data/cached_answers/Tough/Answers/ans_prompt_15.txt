Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if a triangle with sides 8 cm, 15 cm, and 17 cm is a right triangle. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling what a right triangle is. A right triangle is one where one of the angles is exactly 90 degrees, and it's characterized by the Pythagorean theorem. That theorem says that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Okay, so to apply this theorem, I need to identify which side is the longest because that should be the hypotenuse. Looking at the sides, 17 cm is the longest, so I'll assume that's the hypotenuse. The other two sides are 8 cm and 15 cm. Let me write this down:

Hypotenuse (c) = 17 cm  
Side a = 8 cm  
Side b = 15 cm

According to the Pythagorean theorem, the relationship should be:

a² + b² = c²

So I need to calculate a² + b² and see if it equals c².

Let me compute a² first: 8 cm squared is 8*8, which is 64.

Then, b² is 15 cm squared, so 15*15 is 225.

Adding these together: 64 + 225. Let me do the math: 64 plus 200 is 264, and then plus 25 more is 289.

So, a² + b² equals 289.

Now, let's see what c² is. c is 17 cm, so 17 squared is 17*17. Hmm, let me compute that. 10*10 is 100, 7*7 is 49, and then there's the cross terms: 2*10*7, which is 140. Wait, is that right? No, actually, (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². So 17 squared is (10 + 7) squared, which is 10² + 2*10*7 + 7² = 100 + 140 + 49 = 289. Okay, so c² is also 289.

So now I have a² + b² = c², which is 289 = 289. That works out perfectly. Therefore, the triangle with sides 8 cm, 15 cm, and 17 cm satisfies the Pythagorean theorem. So it must be a right triangle.

Wait, but let me think again—maybe I made a mistake in adding or in squaring the numbers. Let me check the squares again.

8 squared: 8*8=64. That's correct.

15 squared: 15*15=225. Yep, that's right.

So adding them up: 64 + 225. Let me do this addition step by step: 64 + 200 is 264, and then +25 is 289. Correct.

17 squared: 17*17. Let's compute it as (10 + 7)^2: 10^2 + 2*10*7 + 7^2=100 + 140 + 49=289. Perfect, so 17 squared is indeed 289.

So 8 squared plus 15 squared equals 17 squared, which means that the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem. Therefore, it's a right triangle.

I can also visualize this. If I imagine a right-angled triangle, the sides would form a sort of "corner," and the Pythagorean theorem helps confirm that the sides are in the correct proportion.

Alternatively, if I didn't remember the Pythagorean theorem, I could try to use coordinate geometry. If I place the triangle on a coordinate plane with one vertex at the origin, another along the x-axis, and the third somewhere in the plane, I could check the distances between these points to see if they form a right angle. But that seems more complicated than needed.

So, yeah, definitely, using the Pythagorean theorem is the straightforward way. It shows that 8-15-17 is a Pythagorean triple, since 8² + 15² = 17². That means the triangle is right-angled.

Just to make sure I didn't confuse it with other triangles, I know that not all sets of numbers satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. So a triangle with sides 5, 12, 13 is right-angled because 5² + 12² = 13², which is 25 + 144 = 169. Similarly, a triangle with sides 7, 24, 25 is also right-angled. So, 8, 15, 17 must be another such triple, specifically the one where the legs are 8 and 15, and the hypotenuse is 17.

In conclusion, the triangle with sides 8 cm, 15 cm, and 17 cm is indeed a right triangle because the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side, satisfying the Pythagorean theorem.

To determine if a triangle with sides of lengths 8 cm, 15 cm, and 17 cm is a right triangle, we apply the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Given:
- Hypotenuse (c) = 17 cm
- Side a = 8 cm
- Side b = 15 cm

We calculate the squares:
- \( a^2 = 8^2 = 64 \)
- \( b^2 = 15^2 = 225 \)
- \( c^2 = 17^2 = 289 \)

According to the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]
\[ 64 + 225 = 289 \]
\[ 289 = 289 \]

Since the equation holds true, the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem, confirming that it is a right triangle.

**Answer:** Yes, the triangle is a right triangle because it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
