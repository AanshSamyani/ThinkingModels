Alright, so I have this problem here: A rectangle has a length that's 5 times its width. The area is 125 square cm. I need to find the dimensions, which means I have to figure out the length and the width. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First off, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. The formula is:

Area = Length × Width

In this problem, they've given me that the length is 5 times the width. That means if I let the width be a certain value, the length will naturally be 5 times that. Let me assign variables to these to make it easier.

Let me call the width "w". Then, the length, which is 5 times the width, would be 5w. So now, my variables are w for the width and 5w for the length.

Now, plugging these into the area formula, I can write:

Area = (5w) × w

Which simplifies to:

Area = 5w²

They've also told me that the area is 125 square cm. So, I can set up the equation:

5w² = 125

Now, my goal is to solve for w, which is the width. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

w² = 125 / 5

Calculating that gives me:

w² = 25

Alright, so if w squared is 25, then w must be the square root of 25. Remembering my math from earlier, the square root of 25 is 5. So,

w = √25
w = 5

Okay, so the width is 5 cm. Now, since the length is 5 times the width, I can find the length by multiplying 5 by the width, which is 5 cm.

Length = 5 × w
Length = 5 × 5
Length = 25

So, the length is 25 cm, and the width is 5 cm. Let me double-check to make sure I did that right.

Calculating the area with these dimensions:

Area = Length × Width = 25 cm × 5 cm = 125 cm²

Yes, that matches the given area of 125 square cm. So, the dimensions are correct. The width is 5 cm, and the length is 25 cm.

Just to recap the steps: I assigned variables based on the given relationship (length is 5 times the width), formed the area equation, solved for the width, then used that to find the length. Checking the answer ensured that I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, just a thought: Sometimes, in problems, if I set up variables and get a positive number, do I need to consider negative roots? But in the context of width, a negative width doesn't make sense because width can't be negative. So, I only take the positive square root, which is 5 cm, so that's fine.

Also, checking that I substituted correctly in the equation: 5w² = 125, which becomes w² = 25, so w is indeed 5. Everything seems consistent here.

I think that's all I need to do. I found both the width and the length by using the given ratio and the area, and everything checks out. So, I can confidently say that the rectangle has a width of 5 cm and a length of 25 cm.

**Final Answer**
The dimensions of the rectangle are \boxed{25} cm in length and \boxed{5} cm in width.

Given a rectangle where the length is 5 times the width and the area is 125 square cm, we need to find the dimensions.

1. Let the width be \( w \). Then, the length is \( 5w \).
2. The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
   \]
3. Substituting the known values:
   \[
   125 = 5w \times w
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   125 = 5w^2
   \]
5. Dividing both sides by 5:
   \[
   w^2 = 25
   \]
6. Taking the square root of both sides:
   \[
   w = \sqrt{25} = 5
   \]
7. The width is 5 cm. The length is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) cm.

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are \boxed{25} cm in length and \boxed{5} cm in width.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
