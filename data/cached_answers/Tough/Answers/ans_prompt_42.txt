Okay, so I have this problem here where a pizza is divided into 24 slices, and 12 people are sharing it equally. I need to figure out how many slices each person gets. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, the pizza has a total of 24 slices. That seems straightforward. Now, there are 12 people who are going to share this pizza. So, the question is asking how many slices each person gets if the pizza is divided equally among them. 

Alright, so I think this is a division problem. We have a total number of slices, and we need to divide that by the number of people sharing it. In mathematical terms, that would be total slices divided by number of people. 

Let me write that down. The total number of slices is 24, and the number of people is 12. So, if I do 24 divided by 12, that should give me the number of slices each person gets. 

Let me calculate that. 24 divided by 12 is... well, 12 times 2 is 24. So, 24 divided by 12 equals 2. 

So, each person would get 2 slices of the pizza. That makes sense because if you have 12 people and 24 slices, each person can have exactly 2 slices without any leftovers or shortage. 

I don't think there are any tricks or complexities to this problem. It's pretty straightforward. Maybe the confusion could be if there were different ways to split the pizza or if some people didn't eat equally, but the problem doesn't mention any such details. It just says 12 people share it equally, so equal shares is assumed. 

Therefore, each person gets 2 slices. I don't need to do any more complicated calculations here. It seems too simple, but perhaps it's just a basic division problem. 

Let me just double-check my math. 12 multiplied by 2 is 24, so 24 divided by 12 is definitely 2. Yep, that checks out. 

So, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 2 slices per person.

Each person would get 2 slices. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Total Slices:** The pizza is divided into 24 slices.
2. **Number of People:** 12 people are sharing the pizza equally.
3. **Division Calculation:** 
   \[
   \text{Slices per Person} = \frac{\text{Total Slices}}{\text{Number of People}} = \frac{24}{12} = 2
   \]
4. **Conclusion:** Each person gets 2 slices of pizza.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
