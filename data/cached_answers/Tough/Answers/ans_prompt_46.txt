Okay, so I have this problem here about a car's fuel efficiency and how far it can go on a full tank. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The car goes 40 miles on 1 gallon of gas, and the gas tank holds 12 gallons. I guess the question is asking me to find out how many miles the car can travel on 12 gallons. 

Alright, so fuel efficiency is usually measured in miles per gallon, which tells us how many miles we can drive for each gallon of fuel. In this case, it's 40 miles per gallon. That means every time I put one gallon into the car, it can drive 40 miles. So, if the gas tank can hold 12 gallons, I might think to multiply 40 miles by 12 gallons to find the total distance.

But wait, is it as straightforward as that? Sometimes these problems can get a little tricky, especially if there are different driving conditions or the fuel isn't perfectly efficient. But the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I'll stick to the basic calculation. 

So, mathematically, I would calculate this by multiplying the miles per gallon by the number of gallons. That is, 40 miles/gallon multiplied by 12 gallons. Let me do that multiplication. 

40 times 12 equals... hmm, 4 times 12 is 48, so 40 times 12 should be 480. So, does that mean the car can travel 480 miles on a full tank? That seems plausible. But let me think about it another way to double-check. 

Imagine the car starts with a full tank, which holds 12 gallons. Each gallon brings it 40 miles. So, for the first gallon, it goes 40 miles. The second gallon brings it another 40 miles, totaling 80 miles. The third gallon would take it to 120 miles, and so on. After 12 gallons, it would have driven 12 times 40 miles, which again gives me 480 miles. 

Alternatively, I can think of it in terms of units. Miles per gallon is miles divided by gallons. So, miles/gallon times gallons should cancel out the gallons, leaving me with miles. That makes sense. So, 40 miles/gallon times 12 gallons equals 480 miles. 

But maybe I should also consider whether the gas tank is completely empty before starting. If the tank isn't empty, would that affect the calculation? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume the tank is full when the car starts driving. 

Another point to consider is whether the car can maintain a consistent fuel efficiency throughout the drive. If it's getting less efficient, that would mean the actual distance driven might be less. But since the problem doesn't specify any issues with fuel efficiency during the trip, I'll assume it stays at 40 miles per gallon.

So, putting it all together, the calculation is straightforward. Multiply the fuel efficiency by the tank capacity to get the total miles. So, 40 miles per gallon times 12 gallons equals 480 miles. 

I think that's all there is to it. The problem doesn't offer any hidden complexities or variables that would complicate the solution, so this should be the correct answer.
</think>

The car's fuel efficiency is 40 miles per gallon, and the gas tank holds 12 gallons. To determine how far the car can travel on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons:

\[ 40 \, \text{miles per gallon} \times 12 \, \text{gallons} = 480 \, \text{miles} \]

**Answer:** The car can travel 480 miles on a full tank.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
