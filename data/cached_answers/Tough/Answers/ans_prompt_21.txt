<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>A train travels 360 miles in 6 hours. How long will it take to travel 480 miles at the same speed?<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to figure out how long it will take for a train to travel 480 miles at the same speed it was going before. Let me see... The train already went 360 miles in 6 hours. Hmm, maybe I should start by finding out the train's speed.

Speed is usually calculated as distance divided by time, right? So if I take the distance the train traveled, which is 360 miles, and divide that by the time it took, which is 6 hours, I should get the speed in miles per hour. Let me write that down: 360 miles divided by 6 hours. 

Okay, let's do the math. 360 divided by 6. Hmm, 6 goes into 36 six times, and 6 goes into 0 zero times. So that's 60 miles per hour. So the train is going at 60 mph. That seems reasonable; trains usually go pretty fast, and 60 mph is a good average speed.

Now, I need to find out how long it will take to go 480 miles at this same speed. So I think I can use the same formula, which is time equals distance divided by speed. So if I take the new distance, 480 miles, and divide it by the speed we just found, which is 60 mph, I should get the time it takes.

Let me put that into an equation. Time = 480 miles divided by 60 mph. Let me do that calculation. 480 divided by 60. Well, 60 times 8 is 480, right? So that means it takes 8 hours to go 480 miles at 60 mph. 

Wait, let me double-check that because sometimes when you divide, you might make a mistake. So 60 times 8 is indeed 480 because 60 times 10 is 600, subtract 20, you get 580, wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh no, wait, 60 times 8. Let me do 60 times 8: 6 times 8 is 48, so 60 times 8 is 480. Yeah, that checks out. So 480 divided by 60 is 8. So it takes 8 hours.

Let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The train was going 60 mph. So in one hour, it goes 60 miles. So for 8 hours, it would go 60 times 8, which is 480 miles. Yeah, that makes sense. So the time is 8 hours.

So, the key steps were finding the speed first and then using that speed to find the time for the longer distance. That seems logical. I don't think I made any calculation errors this time, so I'm pretty confident that 8 hours is the right answer.

To determine how long it will take for the train to travel 480 miles at the same speed, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the train's speed:**
   - The train travels 360 miles in 6 hours.
   - Speed = Distance / Time = 360 miles / 6 hours = 60 miles per hour (mph).

2. **Determine the time for 480 miles at 60 mph:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 480 miles / 60 mph = 8 hours.

**Answer:** It will take the train 8 hours to travel 480 miles at the same speed.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
