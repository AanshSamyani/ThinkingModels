Okay, so I need to figure out how far a car can travel on a full gas tank. The car's fuel efficiency is 20 miles per gallon, and the gas tank can hold 18 gallons. 

First, I think about fuel efficiency, which is usually miles per gallon (mpg). That means for every gallon of fuel, the car can travel 20 miles. So, with one gallon, it's 20 miles. But I need to find out how many miles it can go with 18 gallons. 

Hmm, maybe I should multiply the fuel efficiency by the number of gallons. So, 20 miles per gallon times 18 gallons. Let me write that down: 20 * 18. 

Wait, I should make sure if that makes sense. So, each gallon gets me 20 miles, so for two gallons, I get 40 miles. Yeah, that seems right. So, with each additional gallon, I add another 20 miles to the distance I can travel. 

Therefore, 20 miles/gallon * 18 gallons should give me the total distance. Let me calculate that: 20 * 18 equals... 360. Yeah, 360 miles. 

Wait a second, is there another way to check this? Maybe dividing instead. If 1 gallon gets me 20 miles, then how many gallons are in the tank? 18 gallons. So, I can think of it as 18 gallons divided by how many gallons per mile. Wait, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think about how many miles per gallon is 20, so how many gallons would 18 gallons provide. Or, maybe I can calculate how many gallons are in the tank, 18 gallons, multiply by 20 miles per gallon. That's the same thing. So, 18 * 20 is 360 miles.

I think that's right. So, the car can travel 360 miles on a full tank of 18 gallons with a fuel efficiency of 20 miles per gallon.

The car can travel **360 miles** on a full tank of 18 gallons with a fuel efficiency of 20 miles per gallon.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
