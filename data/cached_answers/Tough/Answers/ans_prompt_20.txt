<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>A recipe calls for 4 cups of flour to make 24 cookies. How many cups of flour are needed to make 60 cookies?<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
I need to find out how much flour is required for 60 cookies based on the given recipe. The original recipe makes 24 cookies with 4 cups of flour.

First, I'll determine how much flour is needed for one cookie. Dividing the total cups of flour by the number of cookies gives me 4 cups divided by 24 cookies, which equals approximately 0.1667 cups per cookie.

Next, I'll multiply the amount needed for one cookie by the number of cookies I want to make. Multiplying 0.1667 cups by 60 cookies results in about 10 cups of flour needed.

To ensure accuracy, I'll perform a quick check using the original numbers. If 24 cookies require 4 cups, then 60 cookies would require more. Dividing 60 by 24 gives me 2.5, meaning 2.5 times the original amount of flour should be used, which is 4 cups multiplied by 2.5, totaling 10 cups.

Therefore, the final answer is that 10 cups of flour are required to make 60 cookies.

To determine how many cups of flour are needed to make 60 cookies, let's follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Given Recipe:**
   
   - **Original Recipe:**
     - **Flour Required:** 4 cups
     - **Cookies Made:** 24

2. **Determine the Amount of Flour per Cookie:**
   
   \[
   \text{Flour per Cookie} = \frac{\text{Total Flour}}{\text{Number of Cookies}} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{24} \approx 0.1667 \text{ cups per cookie}
   \]

3. **Calculate Flour Needed for 60 Cookies:**
   
   \[
   \text{Flour for 60 Cookies} = 60 \text{ cookies} \times 0.1667 \text{ cups per cookie} \approx 10 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{10 \text{ cups of flour}}
   \]

By following these steps, you can easily calculate the required amount of flour for any number of cookies based on the given recipe.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
