<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Solve for \( x \): \( 4(x - 5) = 2x + 10 \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
To solve the equation \(4(x - 5) = 2x + 10\), I begin by distributing the 4 on the left side, which gives me \(4x - 20 = 2x + 10\).

Next, I aim to collect like terms. I'll subtract \(2x\) from both sides to eliminate the \(2x\) term on the right, resulting in \(2x - 20 = 10\).

Then, I add 20 to both sides to isolate the term with \(x\), leading to \(2x = 30\).

Finally, I divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(x\), which gives \(x = 15\).

**Solution:**

To solve the equation \(4(x - 5) = 2x + 10\), follow these steps:

1. **Distribute** the 4 on the left side:
   
   \[
   4(x - 5) = 2x + 10 \implies 4x - 20 = 2x + 10
   \]

2. **Bring like terms to one side** by subtracting \(2x\) from both sides:

   \[
   4x - 20 - 2x = 2x + 10 - 2x \implies 2x - 20 = 10
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable** \(x\) by adding 20 to both sides:

   \[
   2x - 20 + 20 = 10 + 20 \implies 2x = 30
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by 2:

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{30}{2} \implies x = 15
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{15}
