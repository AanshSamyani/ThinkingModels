</think>

To solve the equation \( 6(x - 2) = 4x + 12 \), follow these steps:

1. **Distribute the 6 on the left side:**
   \[
   6(x - 2) = 6x - 12
   \]
   So, the equation becomes:
   \[
   6x - 12 = 4x + 12
   \]

2. **Move all \( x \) terms to one side and constant terms to the other side:**
   \[
   6x - 4x = 12 + 12
   \]
   Simplifying both sides:
   \[
   2x = 24
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]

**Final Answer:** \( x = 12 \)<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
