Yes, a triangle with sides of lengths 9 cm, 12 cm, and 15 cm is a right triangle. This can be determined using the **Pythagorean theorem**, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Let's calculate:
- \(9^2 = 81\)
- \(12^2 = 144\)
- \(15^2 = 225\)

According to the theorem:
\[
81 + 144 = 225
\]
\[
225 = 225
\]
Since the equation holds true, the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem, confirming it is a right triangle.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
