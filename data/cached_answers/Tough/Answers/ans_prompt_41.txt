<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>A train travels 300 miles in 5 hours. How long will it take to travel 450 miles at the same speed?<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
First, I need to determine the speed of the train. I'll do this by dividing the total distance traveled by the time taken.

So, the speed of the train is 300 miles divided by 5 hours, which equals 60 miles per hour.

Once I have the speed, I can calculate the time it takes for the train to travel 450 miles by dividing the new distance by the speed.

Therefore, the time required is 450 miles divided by 60 miles per hour, which equals 7.5 hours.

To make this clearer, 7.5 hours is the same as 7 hours and 30 minutes.

**Solution:**

We are given that a train travels 300 miles in 5 hours. We need to determine the time it will take for the train to travel 450 miles at the same speed.

**Step 1: Determine the Speed of the Train**

First, calculate the speed of the train using the formula:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the Time to Travel 450 Miles**

Next, use the speed to find the time required to travel 450 miles.

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{450 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 3: Convert Hours to Hours and Minutes**

For clarity, we can express 7.5 hours as:

\[
7.5 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours and } 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{7\,\text{hours}\,30\,\text{minutes}}
