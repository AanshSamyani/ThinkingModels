Okay, so I have this triangle with sides measuring 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm. The question is whether this is a right triangle. Hmm, right triangles, right. I remember something about the Pythagorean theorem from geometry class. Let me try to recall how that works.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (which is the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. So, if the triangle is a right triangle, then the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides should equal the square of the longest side.

First, I need to identify which side is the longest because that's going to be the potential hypotenuse. Looking at the sides, they are 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm. Clearly, 25 cm is the longest side. So, 25 cm is the hypotenuse if this is a right triangle.

Alright, so let's apply the Pythagorean theorem here. The formula is:

\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)

Where \( c \) is the hypotenuse. Plugging in the values, we have:

\( 7^2 + 24^2 = 25^2 \)

Let me compute each term step by step. Starting with \( 7^2 \):

7 squared is 49.

Next, \( 24^2 \). Hmm, 24 times 24... Let's compute that. 24 times 20 is 480, and 24 times 4 is 96, so adding them together, 480 + 96 is 576. So, 24 squared is 576.

Now, adding those two results together: 49 + 576.

Let me add them: 49 + 500 would be 549, but I only have 49 + 576. Let's break it down more carefully:

49 + 576. Adding the units place: 9 + 6 = 15. So, I put down 5 and carry over 1. Then, tens place: 4 + 7 = 11, plus the carried 1 makes 12. So, 2. Then, hundreds place: 0 + 5 = 5. So, putting it all together, 49 + 576 = 625.

Wait, hold on. That seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I did something wrong.

7 squared is definitely 49. 24 squared, 24 times 24: Let's use another method. I can break it down as (20 + 4)(20 + 4) = 20*20 + 20*4 + 4*20 + 4*4 = 400 + 80 + 80 + 16 = 400 + 160 + 16 = 576. So that's correct. 400 + 160 is 560, plus 16 is 576. So, 24 squared is indeed 576.

So, 7 squared is 49, 24 squared is 576. 49 + 576 = 625.

Now, let's compute the hypotenuse squared: 25 squared.

25 times 25 is a classic. I think it's 625. Yes, because 20 squared is 400, 5 squared is 25, and then cross terms: 2*20*5 is 200. Adding them: 400 + 200 + 25 = 625. So, 25 squared is 625.

Putting it all together: 49 + 576 = 625. So, that means 7 squared plus 24 squared equals 25 squared.

Therefore, according to the Pythagorean theorem, this triangle is a right triangle because the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side.

But wait, I should make sure that these side lengths actually form a triangle in the first place. I mean, even if it satisfies the theorem, do these sides actually form a valid triangle?

I remember that for three sides to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, let's check that.

First, 7 + 24 > 25? 7 + 24 is 31, which is greater than 25. That works.

Next, 7 + 25 > 24? 7 + 25 is 32, which is greater than 24. Still good.

Lastly, 24 + 25 > 7? 24 + 25 is 49, which is obviously greater than 7. So yes, all three conditions are satisfied. Therefore, these sides do form a valid triangle.

Since they satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, it must be a right triangle.

So, putting it all together: sides 7, 24, and 25 satisfy the Pythagorean theorem (7² + 24² = 25²), and they also satisfy the triangle inequality theorem (sums of sides exceed the third side). Therefore, this is a right triangle.

I think that makes sense. Let me just visualize it for a moment. If I had a triangle with sides 7, 24, and 25, it would form a right-angled triangle with the sides 7 and 24 as the legs, and 25 as the hypotenuse. The legs being 7 and 24 would actually form a sort of skinny right triangle because 24 is not that much larger than 7.

But the math checks out. So, yeah, that should be the case.
</think>

The triangle with side lengths 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm is a right triangle. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify the longest side**: The longest side is 25 cm, which will be the hypotenuse if the triangle is right-angled.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem**:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]
   where \(a = 7\), \(b = 24\), and \(c = 25\).

3. **Compute the squares**:
   \[
   7^2 = 49,\quad 24^2 = 576,\quad 25^2 = 625
   \]

4. **Sum of squares of shorter sides**:
   \[
   49 + 576 = 625
   \]

5. **Compare to hypotenuse squared**:
   \[
   625 = 625
   \]
   Thus, the equation holds true, confirming it's a right triangle.

6. **Verify triangle inequality**:
   - \(7 + 24 > 25\) → \(31 > 25\)
   - \(7 + 25 > 24\) → \(32 > 24\)
   - \(24 + 25 > 7\) → \(49 > 7\)
   All conditions are satisfied.

**Conclusion**: The triangle is a right triangle because the Pythagorean theorem holds, and the sides satisfy the triangle inequality.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
