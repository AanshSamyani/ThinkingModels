<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>A train travels 420 miles in 7 hours. How long will it take to travel 600 miles at the same speed?<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, the train goes 420 miles in 7 hours. I need to find out how long it will take to go 600 miles at the same speed. Hmm, okay, speed is distance divided by time, right? So, maybe I should start by finding the train's speed.

Let me write that down. Speed equals distance over time. So, speed = 420 miles / 7 hours. Let me calculate that. 420 divided by 7... Hmm, 7 times 60 is 420, right? So, 420 divided by 7 is 60. So, the speed is 60 miles per hour. Got it.

Now that I know the speed, I can figure out how long it takes to go 600 miles. Time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, time = 600 miles / 60 miles per hour. Let me compute that. 600 divided by 60... Well, 60 times 10 is 600, so the time should be 10 hours. That seems straightforward.

Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If the train is going 60 miles every hour, then in one hour it goes 60 miles, so over 10 hours, it should be 10 times 60, which is 600 miles. Yeah, that checks out.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of proportions. If 7 hours corresponds to 420 miles, then 1 hour corresponds to 60 miles, as we found before. So, for 600 miles, how many hours would that be? Since each hour is 60 miles, it would take 600 divided by 60, which is 10 hours. Yep, same answer.

I don't think I made any errors here. The steps seem logical and consistent. So, I'm pretty confident the answer is 10 hours.

To determine how long it will take the train to travel 600 miles at the same speed, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the train's speed**:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{420 \text{ miles}}{7 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ miles per hour (mph)}
   \]

2. **Use the speed to find the time for 600 miles**:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{600 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Answer:** It will take the train 10 hours to travel 600 miles at the same speed.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
