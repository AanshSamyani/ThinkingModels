Okay, so I have this problem where a train travels 240 miles in 4 hours, and I need to figure out how long it will take to travel 360 miles at the same speed. Alright, let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand it correctly.

First, I know that speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. So, if the train covers 240 miles in 4 hours, I can find its speed by using the formula:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

Plugging in the values I have, it would be:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Wait, so the train is moving at 60 miles every hour. That seems pretty fast, but okay, maybe it's a high-speed train. Anyway, that seems right because 4 hours multiplied by 60 miles per hour gives me 240 miles. Let me double-check that:

\[
60 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles}
\]

Yep, that checks out. So, the speed is confirmed to be 60 mph.

Now, the next part of the problem is asking how long it will take the same train to travel 360 miles at this speed. So, basically, I need to find the time it takes to cover 360 miles when moving at 60 mph. To do this, I can rearrange the speed formula to solve for time. The formula becomes:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the values I have:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{360 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

So, it would take the train 6 hours to travel 360 miles at 60 mph.

Wait a minute, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using proportions. If the train goes 240 miles in 4 hours, how many hours does it take for 360 miles?

I can set up a proportion where 240 miles corresponds to 4 hours, and 360 miles corresponds to x hours:

\[
\frac{240}{4} = \frac{360}{x}
\]

Simplifying 240/4 gives me 60, so:

\[
60 = \frac{360}{x}
\]

Then, solving for x:

\[
x = \frac{360}{60} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Same answer, so that checks out. I think that's solid. So, regardless of the method, the time required is 6 hours.

But just to be thorough, let me think about this in terms of unit analysis. The speed is 60 miles per hour, which is the same as 60 hours^{-1}. So, when I want to find time, it's distance multiplied by hours per mile. Wait, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since speed is in miles per hour, time is in hours, so it's just distance divided by speed. So, yeah, 360 miles divided by 60 mph gives me 6 hours. No units messed up there.

Is there a way to verify this answer without calculating it directly? Maybe by comparing the time it takes to travel different segments at a constant speed. If 240 miles takes 4 hours, how much time per mile is that?

240 miles in 4 hours is 60 mph. So, time per mile is 1/60 hours per mile. Therefore, for 360 miles, it would be:

\[
360 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{60} \text{ hours/mile} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Same answer, again. So, no matter how I approach it, I get 6 hours. It seems pretty consistent.

I guess that's about it. The problem wasn't too complicated, but it's always good to verify through different methods to make sure the answer is correct. It's easy to make a mistake with the units or the speed, especially when dealing with miles per hour, which can sometimes be a tricky ratio because it's a bit counterintuitive when converting between time and distance.

So, yeah, the train at 60 mph would take 6 hours to go 360 miles.
</think>

The train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour. To find the time it takes to travel 360 miles at this speed, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{360 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

**Answer:** It will take the train 6 hours to travel 360 miles.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
