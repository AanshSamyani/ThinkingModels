Yes, this is a right triangle.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the sides:** We have three sides with lengths 11 cm, 60 cm, and 61 cm.

2. **Check for the Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side (hypotenuse). The formula is:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]
   where \( c \) is the hypotenuse.

3. **Assign values:** Let’s assign the sides as:
   - \( a = 11 \) cm
   - \( b = 60 \) cm
   - \( c = 61 \) cm

4. **Calculate squares:**
   - \( a^2 = 11^2 = 121 \) cm²
   - \( b^2 = 60^2 = 3600 \) cm²
   - \( c^2 = 61^2 = 3721 \) cm²

5. **Sum of squares of shorter sides:**
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = 121 + 3600 = 3721 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

6. **Compare with hypotenuse squared:**
   \[
   c^2 = 3721 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
   Since \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \), the Pythagorean theorem holds.

**Conclusion:** Therefore, the triangle with sides 11 cm, 60 cm, and 61 cm is a right triangle.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
