Okay, so I have this problem here about a rectangle. It says the length is 4 times the width, and the perimeter is 60 cm. I need to find the dimensions, which means both the length and the width. Alright, let's see how to approach this.

First, I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, the formula is usually perimeter equals 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So, if I denote the width as, let's say, 'w', then the length should be 4 times that, so '4w'. That makes sense because the length is given as 4 times the width.

So, writing that out, the perimeter formula would be:

Perimeter = 2*(length + width)

Plugging in the expressions we have in terms of 'w':

60 = 2*(4w + w)

Wait, let me check that again. So, replacing length with 4w and width with w, so yes, it's 2*(4w + w). So, let's simplify that inside the parentheses first.

4w + w is 5w, right? Because 4w plus 1w is 5w. So, that reduces the equation to:

60 = 2*(5w)

Which simplifies to 60 = 10w. Wait, hold on, 2 times 5w is 10w, correct. So now, we can solve for 'w'.

Divide both sides of the equation by 10 to isolate 'w':

60 / 10 = 10w / 10

So, that gives 6 = w.

Oh, so the width is 6 cm. That seems reasonable. Then, the length is 4 times that, so 4*6 is 24 cm.

Wait, let me just verify that this makes sense. If the width is 6 and the length is 24, then the perimeter should be 2*(6 + 24), which is 2*(30), so that's 60 cm. Perfect, that matches the given perimeter.

So, putting it all together, the width is 6 cm and the length is 24 cm. That seems to check out.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my initial setup. I started by letting the width be 'w', so the length is 4w, which seems correct. Then I plugged that into the perimeter formula. Did I handle the multiplication correctly?

2*(4w + w) = 2*5w = 10w. Yeah, that's correct. Then 60 = 10w leads to w=6. Hmm, okay, so I think I did it right.

I might also think about this another way, maybe by expressing it as a system of equations. Let me try that.

Let width be 'w', length be 'l'. We know that l = 4w. And the perimeter is 2l + 2w = 60.

So substituting l with 4w in the perimeter equation:

2*(4w) + 2w = 60

Which is 8w + 2w = 60

Adding those together, 10w = 60, so again, w = 6. Then l = 4*6 = 24. So same result.

Therefore, I feel confident that width is 6 cm, length is 24 cm.

I also remember sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with dimensions when translating word problems into equations. For example, someone might mistake width for length or vice versa, but in this case, it's pretty straightforward. Width is given a relationship with length, so we can use that.

Wait, another thought. If someone was given the perimeter and another ratio, how would they approach it? Maybe by using variables, but in this problem, the ratio was given directly: length is four times the width. So, in that case, using those variables seems the most efficient.

Is there a way to do this without using variables? Like, maybe by recognizing the total number of units?

Let me think. If the length is 4 times the width, so for every unit of width, length is 4. So, if width is w, length is 4w, which is the same as 5w in total, right? Because 4w + w = 5w.

So, the perimeter is twice that, which is 10w, as before. So, 10w = 60. Therefore, w=6, and length=24.

Yeah, that seems another way of approaching it.

I wonder if I can think of this in terms of graphical representation. If I draw a rectangle where the length is four times the width, and the perimeter is 60 cm. Each side is divided into segments; maybe this can help visualize it? Hmm, perhaps overcomplicating, but for some learners, that might help.

Alternatively, I could represent this using algebra tiles. Like, having tiles representing width and length, so four times as many length tiles as width tiles. But again, maybe beyond what is needed.

Wait, but let me try it.

If I let each width unit be represented by 1 cm, and the length is 4 cm per unit. Then, arranging them, but no, it's getting too convoluted.

Maybe that's overcomplicating; the algebra approach is straightforward here.

Is there any other way to verify this answer? Maybe by plugging back in.

If width is 6, length is 24, so perimeter would be 2*(6 +24)=2*30=60. Exactly the perimeter given. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if the width was not 6, say 5, then length would be 20, and perimeter would be 2*(5 +20)=2*25=50, which is less than 60. So, that's not the right width.

Similarly, if width was 7, length 28, perimeter is 2*(7+28)=2*35=70, which is more than 60. So, that won't work either.

Therefore, 6 and 24 cm make sense.

So, wrapping it up, dimensions are 6 cm and 24 cm. So, width 6 cm, length 24 cm. Alternatively, the length is four times the width, so yes.

I think I've thought through this thoroughly. My initial thought, the process, and verification all point to the same answer. Unless I made a fundamental arithmetic mistake, which I don't think so, but let me double-check the calculations just to be sure.

Starting again:

Perimeter P = 2*(l + w) = 60

Given l = 4w

So, substitute:

2*(4w + w) = 60

Simplify inside:

2*(5w) = 60

Multiply:

10w = 60

Divide both sides by 10:

w = 6

Then l =4w=24

Thus, width=6 cm, length=24 cm.

All right, calculations seem consistent.

I think that's about it. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations.

**Final Answer**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of \boxed{6} cm and a length of \boxed{24} cm.
</think>

Given a rectangle with a length that is 4 times its width and a perimeter of 60 cm, we need to find the dimensions.

1. Let the width be \( w \). Then, the length is \( 4w \).
2. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]
3. Substituting the given values:
   \[
   60 = 2 \times (4w + w)
   \]
4. Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   60 = 2 \times (5w)
   \]
5. Simplify further:
   \[
   60 = 10w
   \]
6. Solve for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{60}{10} = 6
   \]
7. Calculate the length:
   \[
   \text{Length} = 4w = 4 \times 6 = 24
   \]

Thus, the dimensions of the rectangle are a width of \boxed{6} cm and a length of \boxed{24} cm.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
