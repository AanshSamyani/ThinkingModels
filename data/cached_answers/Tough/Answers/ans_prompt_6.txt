Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how far a car can travel on a full gas tank. The car's fuel efficiency is 30 miles per gallon, and the gas tank can hold 15 gallons. 

Alright, let me start by understanding the problem. Fuel efficiency tells me how many miles the car can go on one gallon of fuel. So, 30 miles per gallon means that every time I put one gallon into the tank, the car can drive 30 miles. Got it. 

Now, the gas tank can hold 15 gallons. That means I can fill up 15 gallons before starting a trip. So, I need to find out how far the car can go with all those gallons in the tank. 

Hmm, I think I can use multiplication for this. If one gallon takes me 30 miles, then 15 gallons should take me 30 miles multiplied by 15. Let me write that down: 

Distance = Fuel Efficiency × Tank Capacity  
Distance = 30 miles/gallon × 15 gallons  
Distance = 450 miles  

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 30 miles per gallon times 15 gallons should give me the total miles the car can go on a full tank. Yeah, that makes sense. 

Let me think of another way to approach this. If I fill up 15 gallons, and the car does 30 miles for each gallon, then each gallon allows me to go 30 miles, so 15 gallons should be 15 times 30 miles. 

Another way to look at it is to break it down into smaller parts. For example, if I drive 30 miles using one gallon, then 15 gallons would be 30 miles × 15. That still gives me 450 miles. 

Maybe I can visualize this. Imagine the gas tank is filled up, and as I drive, the gas is consumed at a rate of 30 miles per gallon. After driving 30 miles, one gallon is used up. Then, I can continue driving another 30 miles, using another gallon, and so on, until the tank is empty. 

Since the tank can hold 15 gallons, the car will go through this 30-mile drive process 15 times. So, 30 miles × 15 is 450 miles. 

I think I've approached it from a couple of different angles, and they all lead me to the same conclusion. Multiplying the fuel efficiency by the tank capacity gives me the total distance the car can travel on a full tank. 

Just to make sure, I'll try plugging in smaller numbers. If the car only had 1 gallon in the tank and did 30 miles per gallon, then it would go 30 miles. If it had 2 gallons, it would go 60 miles, right? So, using 15 gallons, it should go 30 times 15 miles, which is 450 miles. 

That seems consistent. I can't think of any other factor that would affect this calculation. The problem doesn't mention anything about traffic, uphill, or anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume the fuel efficiency stays the same throughout the trip. 

Another consideration: Is the 30 miles per gallon a continuous efficiency, or does it change at any point, like when you stop for gas? I think for the purpose of this problem, it's considered a constant, so we don't have to account for any potential efficiency loss. 

So, wrapping it up, by multiplying the fuel efficiency of 30 miles per gallon by the capacity of 15 gallons, we find that the car can travel 450 miles on a full tank. This makes sense logically and checks out with smaller examples and the given numbers. 

I think I'm confident with this answer now. It's straightforward multiplication, but it's easy to overlook when first learning about fuel efficiency and tank capacities. Breaking it down step by step really helps ensure that there are no mistakes in the calculation. 

Just to recap, the process is:

1. Determine the car's fuel efficiency: 30 miles per gallon.
2. Identify the tank capacity: 15 gallons.
3. Multiply these two values together to find the total distance the car can travel on a full tank:
   Distance = 30 × 15 = 450 miles.

Yep, that's the process. I think I've got it!
</think>

The car can travel 450 miles on a full tank.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Fuel Efficiency:** The car consumes 30 miles for each gallon of gasoline.
   
2. **Gas Tank Capacity:** The tank holds 15 gallons of fuel.

3. **Calculate Total Distance:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Fuel Efficiency} \times \text{Tank Capacity} = 30 \, \text{miles/gallon} \times 15 \, \text{gallons} = 450 \, \text{miles}
   \]

**Conclusion:** The car can travel 450 miles on a full tank of gasoline.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
