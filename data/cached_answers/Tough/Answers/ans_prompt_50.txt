I need to determine how many cups of flour are needed to make 96 cookies, given that 8 cups of flour make 48 cookies.

First, I'll find the amount of flour required for each cookie by dividing the total amount of flour by the number of cookies.

Next, I'll use this amount of flour per cookie to calculate the total amount needed for 96 cookies by multiplying the flour per cookie by the number of cookies.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- A recipe requires **8 cups of flour** to make **48 cookies**.

**Question:**
- How many **cups of flour** are needed to make **96 cookies**?

**Solution:**

1. **Find the amount of flour needed per cookie:**
   
   \[
   \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{8 \text{ cups}}{48 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup per cookie}
   \]

2. **Calculate the flour needed for 96 cookies:**
   
   \[
   \text{Flour for 96 cookies} = 96 \text{ cookies} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup per cookie} = 16 \text{ cups}
   \]

**Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16 \text{ cups}}
