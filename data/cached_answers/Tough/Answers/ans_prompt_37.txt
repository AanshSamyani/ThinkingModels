Alright, so I've got this problem here: "A number is decreased by 20%, and the result is 80. What was the original number?" Hmm, okay, let me break this down. First off, I need to figure out what the original number was before it was decreased by 20%. The result after the decrease is 80, so I guess I need to reverse engineer that somehow.

Alright, let's start by understanding what it means to decrease a number by 20%. If I have a number, say, N, and I decrease it by 20%, that means I'm taking away 20% of N from itself. So, mathematically, that would be N minus 20% of N, right? Or, in formula terms, N - (20/100)*N. That simplifies to N*(1 - 0.20), which is N*0.80. So, decreasing a number by 20% gives me 0.80 times the original number.

Now, according to the problem, after this decrease, the result is 80. So, if 0.80 times the original number is equal to 80, I can set up the equation: 0.80*N = 80. To find N, I just need to solve for it. That should be straightforward. I'll divide both sides of the equation by 0.80 to isolate N.

Let me write that out: N = 80 / 0.80. Hmm, let's do the division. 80 divided by 0.80 is the same as 80 divided by 8/10, right? Which is 80 multiplied by 10/8. So, that's 80*(10/8). Simplifying that, 80 divided by 8 is 10, and then multiplied by 10 gives 100. So, N equals 100. Okay, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait a second, let me verify it. If the original number was 100, and I decrease it by 20%, that's 100 minus 20, which equals 80. Yep, that matches the problem's statement. So, that checks out. But let me think again about how I set up the equation. I took 0.80 times N equals 80. Is that correct? I mean, decreasing by 20% leaves 80% of the original number, right? So, 80 is 80% of N, which is 0.80*N. Yep, that seems correct.

I'm feeling pretty confident about this answer. But just to be thorough, let's consider another way of approaching the problem. Maybe by thinking in terms of percentages and actual numbers instead of just variables.

Suppose the original number is N. 20% of N is (20/100)*N, which is 0.20*N. So, decreasing N by 20% would be N - 0.20*N = 0.80*N. As I did before, and we know this equals 80. So, again, 0.80*N = 80 leads to N = 100.

Alternatively, I can think about the percentage decrease in terms of ratios. If 80 is 80% of the original number, then the original number must be 100% of N. So, 80 is to N as 80% is to 100%, which can be set up as a proportion: 80 / N = 80% / 100%. Which simplifies to 80 / N = 0.80 / 1.00. So, cross-multiplying, 0.80*N = 80, which again gives N = 100. So, no matter which way I approach it, I still end up with N being 100.

Is there another perspective I can take here? Maybe using algebraic manipulation. Starting from the problem statement, "A number is decreased by 20%, and the result is 80." So, in algebra terms, this is N - 0.20N = 80. Combining like terms, that's 0.80N = 80. Then, solving for N by dividing both sides by 0.80 gives N = 100.

I think I'm overcomplicating this a bit, but it's good to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me summarize my findings: I converted the percentage decrease into a decimal, set up the equation, solved for N, and then verified my answer by plugging it back into the original problem. Everything checks out, so I'm pretty sure the original number was 100.

But just to explore further, what if I approached this problem using fractions instead of decimals? That might help reinforce my understanding. 20% is equivalent to 1/5, right? So, decreasing a number by 1/5 would leave us with 4/5 of the original number. So, if the result is 80, then 4/5 of N equals 80. Therefore, N is 80 divided by 4/5. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so that's 80 * (5/4), which is (80/4)*5 = 20*5 = 100. So, again, I get N equals 100. So, that confirms it once more.

Another way to think about it is using proportions. If 80 is to 100 as 20% is to 80, but wait, that might not be the right proportion. Maybe it's better to set up the ratio as (100% - 20%) : 100% = 80 : N. So, that would be 80% : 100% = 80 : N. Therefore, 0.80 = 80/N. Wait, hold on, that can't be right because 0.80 is 80%, so that would imply 0.80 = 80/N, which when rearranged gives N = 80 / 0.80 = 100. So, yeah, that's consistent.

Alternatively, thinking about what fraction remains after a 20% decrease. If 20% is taken away, you're left with 80%, so the remaining amount is 80% of the original. Therefore, if 80% of N is 80, then N is 80 divided by 0.80, which is 100. So, yeah, all these methods are leading me to the same answer.

Is there any way I can represent this problem graphically? Maybe plotting the percentage decrease against the original number. But since this is a simple linear relationship, I think graphically it might not add much value, except to visualize the concept. Let's say I have a number line with N at some point, and then I move 80% of the way to decrease N by 20% to land on 80. But that seems more complicated than necessary.

Perhaps using a bar model to represent the problem. Imagine a bar representing the original number N, and then a portion of it that's 80, which is 80% of N. So, the bar N is split into 100%, and 20% is removed, leaving 80%. So, the remaining 80% is 80, and I can find N by seeing how much 80 corresponds to 80%. That would again give N as 100.

I think at this point, I've convinced myself that the original number must be 100. I've approached the problem from multiple angles—using decimal multiplication, fractions, proportions, algebraic equations, and even graphically—and every method consistently leads to the conclusion that N is 100. I don't see any flaw in my reasoning, and the verification by plugging the answer back into the original problem also solidifies the correctness of it.

So, after carefully considering different methods and verifying each time, I can confidently say that the original number must have been 100. That was a good exercise in understanding percentage decreases and how they relate to the original number.

The original number was 100. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. Let N be the original number.
2. A 20% decrease on N means we take away 20% of N, leaving 80% of N.
3. In mathematical terms: 80% of N = 80
4. Converting percentage to decimal: 0.80 * N = 80
5. Solving for N: N = 80 / 0.80 = 100

**Verification:**
- 20% of 100 is 20.
- 100 - 20 = 80, which matches the problem statement.

Therefore, the original number is **100**.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
