<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>A pizza is divided into 12 slices. If 4 people share it equally, how many slices does each person get?<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
To determine how many slices each person gets, I will start by noting that the pizza is divided into 12 slices.

Next, I'll consider that there are 4 people sharing the pizza equally.

To find out how many slices each person receives, I'll divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

This calculation will give the exact number of slices that each person gets.

**Solution:**

1. **Number of Slices:**
   - Total number of slices in the pizza = 12 slices.

2. **Number of People Sharing:**
   - Number of people = 4.

3. **Slices per Person:**
   - To find out how many slices each person gets, divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
     \[
     \text{Slices per person} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{12}{4}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Slices per person} = 3
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3}
