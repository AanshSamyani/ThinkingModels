Okay, so I have this problem here: a car's fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon, and its gas tank can hold 20 gallons. The question is, how far can the car travel on a full tank? Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me think through it step by step to make sure I understand everything correctly.

First, fuel efficiency is usually measured in miles per gallon, which is how many miles you can drive on one gallon of fuel. So in this case, 25 miles per gallon means that the car can go 25 miles for every gallon of fuel it uses. That makes sense. So if I have 20 gallons, then theoretically, if I keep driving without stopping or refueling, I should be able to drive 25 miles for each gallon times the number of gallons I have.

Wait, let me write that down to visualize it better. So, if fuel efficiency (mpg) is 25, and the tank capacity is 20 gallons, then the total distance would be mpg multiplied by gallons. So, 25 mpg * 20 gallons = 500 miles. That seems like a lot, but let me break it down.

Each gallon gets me 25 miles. So, starting with an empty tank, I put 20 gallons in. Each gallon adds 25 miles to the trip. So, adding 25 miles per gallon for each of the 20 gallons would be 25 * 20. Let me do the multiplication to double-check. 25 times 20 is indeed 500. Okay, so that's 500 miles on a full tank.

Wait a minute, I should make sure that the units work out. Miles per gallon is a ratio of miles to gallons, so when I multiply that by gallons, the gallons unit cancels out, leaving me with miles, which is what I want. That makes sense. So, 25 miles per gallon multiplied by 20 gallons gives me 500 miles. That seems right.

But let me think about it another way. If I drive for one gallon, which is 25 miles, then after two gallons, I'd have 50 miles, and so on. So for 20 gallons, the distance would be 25 * 20, which is 500. Yeah, that checks out.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using division or fractions. Well, fuel efficiency is about how much distance you get per gallon, so if I take the total amount of gas and multiply by how far it takes to use a gallon, that should give me the total distance.

Alternatively, if I think about it as a unit rate, 25 miles per gallon is the same as 25/1 miles per gallon. So, the distance would be (25/1) * (20/1) gallons. Multiplying those together gives (25*20)/(1*1) = 500/1, which is 500 miles. That confirms my earlier calculation.

I guess another thing to consider is whether the car is always at maximum efficiency or if there are situations where it might be less. But since the problem doesn't specify that, I assume it's consistent at 25 mpg throughout the trip.

Is there a possibility I'm overcomplicating this? Maybe not. I mean, the problem is pretty straightforward, but it's always good to double-check your work. So, going through it again: 25 miles per gallon times 20 gallons equals 500 miles. Yep, that seems correct.

Wait, just to be thorough, what if the car's tank capacity was different, like 15 gallons? Then the distance would be 25 * 15 = 375 miles. But since the tank holds 20 gallons, 500 miles makes sense. That seems reasonable for a city car, which typically has lower fuel efficiencies and lower tank capacities.

Also, thinking about the gas station, if you can drive 25 miles on a gallon, how long would it take to go a certain distance? For example, if I wanted to drive 50 miles, that would take 2 gallons (since 25 miles take 1 gallon, so 50 miles take 2 gallons). But in this case, the total gas in the tank is 20 gallons, so I'd have enough to drive 500 miles.

Is there any chance that the problem is asking for something else? Like, maybe how much it would take to fill up the tank or something else? But no, the question is pretty clear: how far can the car travel on a full tank? So, 500 miles should be the answer.

Just to think about it another way: If I drive 25 miles each gallon, then how many gallons does it take to drive 500 miles? That would be 500 / 25 = 20 gallons. Which matches the tank capacity. So that adds up.

Wait, that's an interesting way to think about it. Since the tank can hold 20 gallons, and each gallon gets me 25 miles, I can drive 25*20=500 miles. So yes, that also makes sense. So the math checks out from different angles.

I think I'm pretty confident now that 500 miles is the correct answer. It seems to make sense both from the multiplication of mpg and tank capacity and also from thinking about how many gallons are needed to drive a certain distance.

The car can travel 500 miles on a full tank.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Data:**
   - Fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, mpg): 25 mpg
   - Gas tank capacity: 20 gallons

2. **Calculate Total Distance:**
   - Multiply the fuel efficiency by the tank capacity.
   - Distance = mpg × gallons
   - Distance = 25 miles/gallon × 20 gallons

3. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - 25 × 20 = 500

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The car can travel 500 miles on a full tank of gas.

**Final Answer:**
The car can travel **500 miles** on a full tank.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
