Alright, so I've got this problem here about a shop that sells apples and pears. Let me see if I can figure out how much someone would pay for buying some apples and pears. Hmm, okay, the price of each apple is $0.80, and each pear is $0.50. The person is buying 10 apples and 6 pears. I need to calculate the total cost.

Okay, so first things first, let's break it down. If I can figure out how much 10 apples cost, and separately figure out how much 6 pears cost, then I can just add those two amounts together to get the total cost. That makes sense. So, for the apples, each one is $0.80, right? So, for 10 apples, that would be 10 multiplied by $0.80. Let me do that calculation. 10 times 0.80 is... hmm, 10 times 0.8 is 8.00. So, 10 apples would cost $8.00. That seems straightforward.

Now, moving on to pears. Each pear is $0.50, and the person is buying 6 pears. So, that should be 6 times $0.50. Let me compute that. 6 multiplied by 0.50. Well, 6 times 0.5 is 3.00. So, 6 pears would cost $3.00. Wait, hold on. If each pear is $0.50, then 6 pears would be 6 times that. So, $0.50 times 6. Let me write that down: 0.50 × 6. That's 3.00. Yep, that's right. So, 6 pears cost $3.00.

Now, to get the total amount the person would pay, I need to add the cost of apples and the cost of pears. So, that's $8.00 plus $3.00. Let me add those together. 8 plus 3 is 11. So, $8.00 plus $3.00 equals $11.00. Therefore, the total amount the person would pay is $11.00.

Wait a second, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10 apples at $0.80 each: 10 × 0.80 is indeed $8.00. And 6 pears at $0.50 each: 6 × 0.50 is $3.00. Adding them together: $8.00 + $3.00 = $11.00. Yep, that seems correct.

But just to be thorough, let me think about it another way. Maybe I can calculate the total cost another way to see if I get the same result. For example, instead of adding separately, I could calculate the total number of fruits and then multiply by the average price, but that might complicate things. Let me see.

Alternatively, I could compute the total cost by multiplying the quantity by the price for each fruit and then adding them up. Wait, that's what I did before. Hmm.

Another way could be to look at the decimal places and see if I can simplify the calculation. For the apples, 10 × 0.80 is 8.00. For the pears, 6 × 0.50 is 3.00. Adding them gives 11.00. That seems consistent.

I guess another way to approach this is to consider the cost per fruit and see how much each fruit contributes to the total. For apples, the cost is $0.80, and for pears, $0.50. So, 10 apples contribute 10 × 0.80, which is 8.00, and 6 pears contribute 6 × 0.50, which is 3.00. Adding them gives 11.00.

Wait, could there be any tax or other charges involved? The problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I can assume we're just dealing with the total cost of the apples and pears.

Let me also check if I can verify the calculations using another method. Maybe I can think in terms of money.

If I have $8.00 for the apples, and then I add $3.00 for the pears, that's going to give me $11.00. Alternatively, if I have 10 apples at $0.80 each, that's 8 dollars and 20 cents, because 10 times 0.80 is 8.00 plus 20 cents, which is 11.00. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, 10 × 0.80 is 8.00, right? Because 10 × 0.80 is 8.00. So, that's correct.

Wait, but 10 × 0.80 is 8.00? Let me think again. 0.80 times 10 is 8.00. Yes, that's correct. And 0.50 times 6 is 3.00. So, adding 8.00 and 3.00 gives 11.00. Hmm, I'm starting to feel confident about that answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any simple math errors. Sometimes, when you're doing quick calculations, you can slip up. So, let's recalculate the multiplication for the apples. 10 apples times $0.80 each: 10 × 0.80. Let's write it out as 10 × 0.80.

So, 0.80 is the same as 80 cents per apple. So, 80 cents times 10 apples is 800 cents. 800 cents is equal to $8.00. So, that checks out. So, 10 apples cost $8.00.

Now, pears: 6 pears times $0.50 each: 6 × 0.50. 0.50 is the same as 50 cents per pear. So, 50 cents times 6 is 300 cents. 300 cents is equal to $3.00. So, 6 pears cost $3.00.

Adding them together: $8.00 + $3.00 = $11.00. That seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me think of another way to calculate the total.

Suppose I consider the cost per apple and per pear, and then compute the total cost for 10 apples and 6 pears. So, each apple is 80 cents, so 10 apples would be 80 cents multiplied by 10, which is 800 cents, or $8.00.

Each pear is 50 cents, so 6 pears would be 50 cents multiplied by 6, which is 300 cents, or $3.00.

Adding $8.00 and $3.00 gives $11.00. Hmm, that still holds up.

Wait, could there be a situation where the prices are calculated differently? For example, if the prices were given as $0.80 and $0.50 per fruit, and the quantities are 10 apples and 6 pears, is there a chance that I misread the quantities? Let me check the problem again.

"If you buy 10 apples and 6 pears, how much will you pay?"

So, 10 apples and 6 pears. Yes, that's correct. So, 10 apples and 6 pears.

So, I don't think I misread that part. So, the quantities are correct.

Alternatively, is there a possibility that the total is calculated by multiplying the number of apples and pears together, but that seems unlikely because each is a separate fruit. So, the total cost should be the sum of the two individual costs, not the product.

So, the total cost is 10 × $0.80 + 6 × $0.50.

Calculating 10 × $0.80 is $8.00.

Calculating 6 × $0.50 is $3.00.

Total cost is $8.00 + $3.00 = $11.00.

Therefore, the person will pay $11.00 in total.

I think I've covered all the possible ways to calculate this and verified the calculations multiple times. So, I'm pretty confident that $11.00 is the correct total amount to be paid for buying 10 apples and 6 pears.

Just to sum it up:

- 10 apples × $0.80 = $8.00

- 6 pears × $0.50 = $3.00

- Total = $8.00 + $3.00 = $11.00

Yeah, that all makes sense. I can't think of any other way this could be calculated or any errors I might have made. I've double-checked the multiplication, the addition, and the interpretation of the problem. Everything lines up correctly.

So, in conclusion, if you buy 10 apples at $0.80 each and 6 pears at $0.50 each, the total cost is $11.00.
</think>

The total cost for purchasing 10 apples and 6 pears is calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the cost of apples:
   \[
   10 \text{ apples} \times \$0.80 \text{ per apple} = \$8.00
   \]

2. Calculate the cost of pears:
   \[
   6 \text{ pears} \times \$0.50 \text{ per pear} = \$3.00
   \]

3. Add both amounts together to find the total cost:
   \[
   \$8.00 + \$3.00 = \$11.00
   \]

**Answer:** You will pay a total of \$11.00.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
