I need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 54 cookies when 18 cookies require 3 cups of flour. This seems like a proportion problem because the amount of flour should increase proportionally with the number of cookies. To solve it, I'll set up a proportion where the cups of flour to the number of cookies are equal for both scenarios.

To determine how many cups of flour are needed for 54 cookies, we can use a proportion based on the given ratio of cups of flour to the number of cookies.

**Given:**
- 3 cups of flour make **18 cookies**.

**Let \( x \)** be the number of cups of flour needed for **54 cookies**.

**Proportion:**
\[
\frac{\text{Cups of flour}}{\text{Number of cookies}} = \frac{\text{Cups of flour}}{\text{Number of cookies}}
\]
\[
\frac{3}{18} = \frac{x}{54}
\]

**Step 1:** Simplify the known proportion.

\[
\frac{3}{18} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

So, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{x}{54}
\]

**Step 2:** Solve for \( x \).

\[
x = \frac{54}{6} = 9
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{9}
