Alright, let me see how to tackle this problem. So, the question says that a number is increased by 30%, and the result is 65. They want to find out what the original number was. Hmm, okay.

First, I should probably figure out what it means to increase a number by 30%. Let me think about this. If I have a number, say, 100, and I increase it by 30%, that means I'm adding 30% of 100 to the original number. So, 30% of 100 is 30, and adding that to 100 gives me 130. So, increasing 100 by 30% gives me 130. That makes sense.

But in this problem, we're dealing with an unknown number. Let me call that original number "x". So, if I increase x by 30%, what do I get? That should be x plus 30% of x, right? Or, in other words, x multiplied by (1 plus 0.30), which is 1.30. So, the equation should be 1.30 * x = 65. Okay, that seems like a good start.

Now, I need to solve for x. To do that, I should divide both sides of the equation by 1.30. So, x equals 65 divided by 1.30. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 65 divided by 1.30. I can do this division step by step.

First, maybe simplify the numbers to make it easier. 65 divided by 1.30. Let me see, 65 divided by 1.3. I can write this as 65 ÷ 1.3. Alternatively, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal, which gives me 650 ÷ 13. That might be easier.

Now, let's compute 650 divided by 13. I remember that 13 times 50 is 650 because 13 times 10 is 130, so 130 times 5 is 650. So, 13 times 50 is 650. That means 650 divided by 13 is 50. So, x equals 50.

Wait a second, does that make sense? Let me check. If I take 50 and increase it by 30%, that should be 50 times 1.30, which is 65. Yes, that matches the result in the problem. So, 50 is the original number.

But just to be thorough, let me verify my steps again. Starting with the equation: 1.30 * x = 65. Solving for x gives x = 65 / 1.30. Dividing 65 by 1.30: 1.30 goes into 65 exactly 50 times because 1.30 * 50 = 65. So, that seems correct.

I was just making sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, I think x = 50 is the right answer.

Alternatively, I can think about percentages in another way. If increasing a number by 30% gives me 65, that means 65 is 130% of the original number. So, 65 divided by 1.30 gives me the original number, which is 50. Yep, same result.

Wait, another way to think about it is to break it down. Let's say 30% of the original number is 65 minus the original number. So, 30% of x = 65 - x. That seems a bit more complicated, but let's see if it leads us somewhere.

So, 0.30x = 65 - x. Adding x to both sides, we get 0.30x + x = 65. That simplifies to 1.30x = 65, which is the same equation we had earlier. So, solving for x still gives x = 50.

Alright, so through different methods—setting up the equation directly, thinking about percentages as proportions, and breaking it down into an equation—I arrive at the same conclusion that the original number was 50. This makes me feel confident that 50 is indeed the correct answer.

Let me recap:

1. The problem states that a number (x) is increased by 30%, resulting in 65.
2. Mathematically, this translates to x + 0.30x = 65, which simplifies to 1.30x = 65.
3. Solving for x gives x = 65 / 1.30 = 50.
4. Verification: 50 * 1.30 = 65, which matches the problem's statement.

Therefore, the original number is 50.
</think>

The original number is found by setting up the equation based on the problem statement:

Let \( x \) be the original number. Increasing it by 30% gives:
\[
x + 0.30x = 65
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
1.30x = 65
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{65}{1.30} = 50
\]
Verification: \( 50 \times 1.30 = 65 \), which confirms the solution.

**Answer:** The original number was 50.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
