Alright, so I've got this problem here: a triangle with sides measuring 10 cm, 24 cm, and 26 cm. The question is asking if it's a right triangle, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, okay, let me start by recalling what a right triangle is. A right triangle is a triangle where one of the angles is exactly 90 degrees. That means that according to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the longest side should equal the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 

Wait a second, so the sides are 10, 24, and 26 cm. I need to identify which one is the longest. Obviously, 26 cm is longer than both 10 and 24 cm. So, 26 cm would be the side opposite the right angle, right? Therefore, if this is a right triangle, then the Pythagorean theorem should hold true. 

Let me write that down to make it clearer. If the triangle is right-angled, then:

\[ (10)^2 + (24)^2 = (26)^2 \]

Calculating each term:

- \(10^2 = 100\)
- \(24^2 = 576\)
- \(26^2 = 676\)

Adding the squares of the two shorter sides:

\[100 + 576 = 676\]

Hmm, that gives:

\[676 = 676\]

Wait, that's interesting. So, \(10^2 + 24^2\) does equal \(26^2\). Does that mean this is a right triangle? It seems to satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, so yes, it's a right triangle. 

But hold on, before I conclude, maybe I should also check the converse of the Pythagorean theorem in case I made a miscalculation. I mean, sometimes when dealing with larger numbers or more complex calculations, it's easy to make an error. Let me verify the calculations again.

Calculating each square again:

- \(10^2 = 10 \times 10 = 100\)
- \(24^2 = 24 \times 24\). Let me compute that. 20 times 20 is 400, 20 times 4 is 80, 4 times 20 is another 80, and 4 times 4 is 16. So adding all those together: 400 + 80 + 80 + 16. That's 400 + 160 = 560, plus 16 is 576. Okay, so that's correct.
- \(26^2 = 26 \times 26\). Hmm, 25 squared is 625, but I know that 26 is just one more. So, maybe I can calculate 26 times 26. 20 times 26 is 520, and 6 times 26 is 156. So 520 + 156 is 676. Yeah, that's right.

So, adding 100 and 576 gives me 676, which equals \(26^2\). So it checks out.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this from another angle to be 100% sure. Let me think about the properties of triangles. For any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. This is known as the triangle inequality theorem. If this weren't true, then the figure couldn't exist as a triangle.

Let's apply that here. The sides are 10, 24, and 26. So, let's check all combinations:

1. \(10 + 24 > 26\)
   \(34 > 26\) ✅

2. \(10 + 26 > 24\)
   \(36 > 24\) ✅

3. \(24 + 26 > 10\)
   \(50 > 10\) ✅

All these inequalities hold true, which means these can form a triangle. But wait, the triangle inequality only tells us that it can form a triangle; it doesn't directly tell us if it's a right triangle. So, since we have already verified via the Pythagorean theorem that \(10^2 + 24^2 = 26^2\), which is a special case of the triangle inequalities, we can be sure that it's a right triangle.

Wait another thought, maybe I can plot these points on a coordinate system to visualize better. Let me assign the sides: 10, 24, 26. If I think of sides 10 and 24 as the legs of a right triangle, then the hypotenuse would have to be sqrt(10^2 + 24^2). Let me calculate sqrt(100 + 576) = sqrt(676) = 26. Perfect, so the hypotenuse is indeed 26, which is the longest side. So, that corroborates again that this is a right triangle.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is with the concept of the dot product. If two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. But this might be a bit more advanced, and since we're dealing with sides, maybe I can relate it differently. Hmm.

Alternatively, I could use trigonometry, but that might not be necessary here. It's more straightforward using the Pythagorean theorem. 

Let me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. A triangle is right-angled if the square of the longest side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, the sides are 10, 24, 26. The longest is 26. Checking 10² + 24² against 26²: 100 + 576 is 676, and 26² is 676. So, it matches. Therefore, it is a right triangle.

Wait, another thought. Sometimes, depending on the values, it's easy to confuse which side is the hypotenuse. So, in this case, we have sides 10, 24, 26. 26 is the largest, so it's the hypotenuse, as we deduced earlier. If instead, the largest side were, say, 24, and if someone incorrectly assigned 24 as the hypotenuse, but that's not our case.

Another verification method: If it were a right triangle, one of the angles should be 90 degrees, and the sides should satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. But given that it passes that test, there's no problem.

Maybe also, just for thoroughness, I can calculate the area in two different ways. If it's a right triangle, the area can be calculated as (base * height)/2. Here, the base and height are the two legs: 10 and 24. So, area is (10 * 24)/2 = 120 cm².

Alternatively, if it's not a right triangle, the area would not correspond to that formula. But since we have the hypotenuse, maybe we can use Heron's formula to compute the area. Let me give that a try.

Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c is sqrt[s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)], where s is the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.

Let's compute s first: (10 + 24 + 26)/2 = (60)/2 = 30 cm.

Then, area = sqrt[30*(30-10)*(30-24)*(30-26)] = sqrt[30*20*6*4].

Calculating that: 30*20=600, 6*4=24, so 600*24=14,400. Thus, area = sqrt[14,400] = 120 cm². 

Wait, same result as before! So both methods give me an area of 120 cm², which matches the area calculated from the right triangle area formula. So that further confirms it's a right triangle.

Wait another thought. If it weren't a right triangle, the area would not equal (base * height)/2. But in both cases, area is 120 cm². So, that reinforces my confidence in it.

Alternatively, I can also compute the height corresponding to the hypotenuse in a right triangle. In a right triangle, the height (altitude) to the hypotenuse can be found by (product of the legs)/hypotenuse. 

Let me compute that: (10 * 24)/26 = 240/26 ≈ 9.23 cm. Then, the area can also be calculated as (hypotenuse * height)/2, which would be (26 * 9.23)/2 ≈ 119.98 cm², which is approximately 120 cm² when rounded, which matches.

So that further verifies the area calculation.

Wait, so if I consider all these methods, all of them point towards the same conclusion: It's a right triangle, with the right angle opposite the side of length 26 cm. 

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe vector analysis or something more advanced, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, I can use the cosine law, which is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem. For any triangle, the cosine of an angle is equal to (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc), where a is the side opposite angle A, and b and c are the other two sides.

But wait, that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps for a right triangle, the cosine of 90 degrees is zero, so cos A = 0, which implies that a² = b² + c². So, same as Pythagorean theorem.

So, whether I approach it directly or through the cosine law, since it's a right triangle, that holds true.

Wait another angle: sometimes, in specific triangles or given side lengths, people might confuse if they form a right triangle or not based on the sides. For example, a 3-4-5 triangle is right-angled, but other combinations might not be, but in this case, it's clear.

Wait, let me also compute the inradius and something like that, just to see if any inconsistencies arise. Maybe the inradius.

The inradius formula is A/s, where A is the area and s is the semi-perimeter.

We already found the semi-perimeter s = 30, area = 120. So, inradius = 120 / 30 = 4 cm.

That seems reasonable, but not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, can we use the formula for the circumradius? Which is (a*b*c)/(4*A).

So, (10*24*26)/(4*120). Let me compute numerator: 10*24=240, 240*26=6,240. Denominator: 4*120=480. Thus, 6,240 / 480 = 13 cm.

Hmm, so the circumradius is 13 cm. That also makes sense, because for a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circumcircle, so the radius is half of that, which is 13 cm, which is indeed half of the hypotenuse 26 cm.

Therefore, that also further supports that it's a right triangle.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the slope of the sides to check if any angle is 90 degrees. For instance, if I take two sides and compute the slopes, then see if the product is -1 (for perpendicular lines). But this might be a more complicated way, but let's try it.

Suppose I have two sides: one from (0,0) to (10,0), and another from (0,0) to (0,24). Then the third side connects (10,0) to (0,24). Let's find the slopes.

First side: from (0,0) to (10,0). That's a horizontal line, slope = 0. Second side: from (0,0) to (0,24). That's a vertical line, undefined slope. Well, wait, vertical and horizontal are obviously perpendicular.

Third side is from (10,0) to (0,24). Let me find the slope here. Slope = (24 - 0)/(0 - 10) = 24 / (-10) = -12/5 = -2.4.

So, the third side has a slope of -2.4. Now, checking the product of the slopes of the first two sides: 0 * undefined is undefined, but in terms of perpendicularity, if one is horizontal and the other is vertical, they are perpendicular.

Therefore, that triangle does indeed have a right angle at (0,0). The slopes of the sides from (0,0) are horizontal and vertical, confirming it's a right triangle.

Alternatively, if I placed the triangle on a coordinate system, perhaps with one vertex at the origin, another at (10,0), and the third at (0,24). Then, by plotting these points, it's easy to see that the angle at (0,0) is 90 degrees.

Another way could be to consider the vectors of the sides. The vectors from the right angle to the other two vertices should be perpendicular. In this case, the vectors from (0,0) are (10,0) and (0,24). The dot product of these two vectors is (10)(0) + (0)(24) = 0. A dot product of zero means they are perpendicular, which confirms the angle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, through various methods—Pythagorean theorem, area verification via Heron's formula, slope calculations, etc.—all of them confirm that this is a right triangle.

But wait a second, just to make sure, I want to consider another perspective. Suppose someone claims that sides of 10, 24, 26 don't form a right triangle but just a scalene triangle, but through our calculations, it's clearly a right triangle. So, unless there's some other nuance I'm missing, which I can't see, this must be a right triangle.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the triangle in terms of the circle. For a triangle to be right-angled, the hypotenuse must be the diameter of the circumcircle. So, in this case, the hypotenuse is 26 cm, so the diameter of the circumcircle is 26 cm, hence the radius is 13 cm. Then, the area can also be calculated using the formula:

Area = (1/2)*base*height.

Here, base is 26 cm, height is the radius, which is 13 cm. So, Area = (1/2)*26*13 = (13)*13 = 169 cm².

Wait, earlier, we found the area using the two legs is 120 cm², and via Heron's formula also 120 cm². Now, using base as 26 and height as 13, it's 169 cm².

There's a discrepancy here. Wait, something's wrong here. So, hold on, if using base as 26 and height as 13, that should be correct because the height is the radius, which is 13. So, 1/2 * 26 * 13 is 169 cm², but our earlier method gave us only 120 cm². Clearly, that's inconsistent.

So, where is the mistake here? Let me recast this.

Wait, wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. If the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circumcircle, then the height of the triangle from the hypotenuse is actually the radius. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Actually, the height with respect to the hypotenuse is the same as the radius. Wait, actually, in a right triangle, the height from the right angle to the hypotenuse is equal to the product of the legs divided by the hypotenuse. So, h = (10 * 24)/26 = 240 / 26 ≈ 9.23 cm.

But wait, if the hypotenuse is the diameter, then the circumradius is 13 cm, so the distance from the circumcenter to any vertex is 13 cm. Wait, but if the hypotenuse is the diameter, then the center of the circumcircle is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse.

So, the height from the right angle to the hypotenuse is equal to the radius, which is 13 cm? Wait, that doesn't make sense because we just computed it as 9.23 cm.

So, now we have this inconsistency. So, this suggests either my misunderstanding of the height or the relationship between the height and the circumradius.

Let me think: In a right triangle, the circumradius is indeed half the hypotenuse, which is 13 cm in our case. The height from the right angle to the hypotenuse is calculated as (leg1 * leg2)/hypotenuse, which is (10 * 24)/26 = 240/26 ≈ 9.23 cm. So, the height is 9.23 cm, which is less than 13 cm.

Therefore, if we take the hypotenuse as the base of the triangle and the height as 9.23 cm, then the area is (1/2)*26*9.23 ≈ 119.98 ≈ 120 cm². But as we've found, the area can also be (1/2)*10*24 = 120 cm². Therefore, it all adds up.

Wait, but why when I thought that the height should be equal to the radius (13 cm), that conflicts? Because actually, the height is a different measure. The radius is the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex, whereas the height is the perpendicular distance from the right angle to the hypotenuse.

In a right triangle, the circumradius is from the center to a vertex, which is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse. The height, as the altitude from the right angle, is different. In a right triangle, those two are related, but not the same. So, the height is not equal to the radius.

Therefore, the confusion is resolved. The height is 9.23 cm, the circumradius is 13 cm, and both give the correct area of 120 cm². So, that's consistent.

Therefore, through all these consistent methods, I can be confident that the triangle with sides 10, 24, and 26 cm is indeed a right triangle.

Wait, perhaps I can also compute the lengths of the medians to see if any of them have specific properties, but perhaps overcomplicating.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of angles. Since in a right triangle, one angle is 90 degrees, and the other two are acute angles. Let's calculate the acute angles.

Using trigonometry, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent. So, for the smaller angle opposite side 10, tan(theta) = 10/24 = 5/12 ≈ 0.4167. Then, theta ≈ arctan(0.4167) ≈ 22.6 degrees. For the other angle, opposite side 24: tan(phi) = 24/10 = 2.4, phi ≈ arctan(2.4) ≈ 67.4 degrees. Then, 22.6 + 67.4 ≈ 90 degrees. So, all angles add up correctly, which aligns with the triangle being right-angled.

That's another way to confirm: using arctangent to find the angles and check if they sum to 90 degrees. All checks out.

Wait, actually, 22.6 + 67.4 is indeed 90 degrees, so that further solidifies that this is a right triangle.

So, summarizing all these methods: using the Pythagorean theorem, calculating the area via two different methods, verifying through coordinate system slopes, confirming with vectors, considering the height as a radius, using medians, and calculating the angles—all of them point towards this triangle being right-angled.

Therefore, I can confidently conclude that the triangle with sides 10 cm, 24 cm, and 26 cm is indeed a right triangle.

Just to recap once more, if the squares of the two shorter sides sum to the square of the longest side, then the triangle is right-angled. So, in this case:

10² + 24² = 100 + 576 = 676
26² = 676

Hence, it's a right triangle. 

In conclusion, after going through multiple approaches and verifying each step meticulously, I don't see any discrepancies or errors in this conclusion. It's a consistent result across various methods, so I'm pretty sure this is correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
</think>

To determine if a triangle with sides of lengths 10 cm, 24 cm, and 26 cm is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. A right triangle satisfies the condition that the square of the longest side (hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

1. Identify the longest side: 26 cm.
2. Calculate the squares of the sides:
   - \(10^2 = 100\)
   - \(24^2 = 576\)
   - \(26^2 = 676\)
3. Check if the sum of the squares of the shorter sides equals the square of the longest side:
   - \(10^2 + 24^2 = 100 + 576 = 676\)
   - \(26^2 = 676\)

Since the equation holds true, the triangle is a right triangle.

Additionally, we verified this through various methods including area calculations, vector analysis, coordinate system slope analysis, and trigonometric calculations. All methods confirmed the triangle is a right triangle.
