I need to determine how much flour is needed to make 72 cookies based on the given recipe. 

First, I'll examine the original recipe to find the ratio of flour to cookies. 

With 6 cups of flour making 36 cookies, there are 6/36 = 1/6 cups of flour per cookie. 

Next, I'll calculate the amount of flour needed for 72 cookies using this ratio: 72 cookies * (1/6 cups of flour per cookie) = 12 cups of flour. 

So, I conclude that 12 cups of flour are required to make 72 cookies.

Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem:**
A recipe calls for 6 cups of flour to make 36 cookies. How many cups of flour are needed to make 72 cookies?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - **Flour required:** 6 cups
   - **Cookies made:** 36 cookies

2. **Find the Amount of Flour per Cookie:**
   - To determine how much flour is needed for one cookie, divide the total flour by the number of cookies.
   
   \[
   \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{6 \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup per cookie}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Amount of Flour for 72 Cookies:**
   - Now, multiply the amount of flour per cookie by the number of cookies needed.
   
   \[
   \text{Flour for 72 cookies} = 72 \text{ cookies} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup per cookie} = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12 \text{ cups}}
