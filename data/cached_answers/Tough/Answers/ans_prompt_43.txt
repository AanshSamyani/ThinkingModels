<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>A rectangle has a length that is 6 times its width. If the perimeter is 84 cm, what are the dimensions?<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
To find the dimensions of the rectangle, I start by letting the width be \( w \) centimeters. Since the length is 6 times the width, the length would then be \( 6w \) centimeters.

Next, I use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \). Plugging in the values, I get the equation \( 84 = 2 \times (6w + w) \).

Simplifying inside the parentheses, I have \( 84 = 2 \times 7w \), which leads to \( 84 = 14w \). Solving for \( w \), I find that the width is \( 6 \) centimeters. 

Finally, calculating the length by multiplying the width by 6, I determine that the length is \( 36 \) centimeters.

To find the dimensions of the rectangle, let's follow these steps:

1. **Let \( w \) represent the width of the rectangle in centimeters.**
2. **Express the length in terms of \( w \):**
   
   Since the length is 6 times the width,
   \[
   \text{Length} = 6w
   \]

3. **Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:**
   
   The perimeter \( P \) is given by,
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
   \]
   
   Substituting the known values,
   \[
   84 = 2 \times (6w + w)
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   84 = 2 \times 7w \\
   84 = 14w
   \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**
   \[
   w = \frac{84}{14} \\
   w = 6 \text{ cm}
   \]

6. **Find the length:**
   \[
   \text{Length} = 6w = 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ cm}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\text{Width: 6 cm, Length: 36 cm}}
