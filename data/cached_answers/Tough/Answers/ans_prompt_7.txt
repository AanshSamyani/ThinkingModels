<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>A number is increased by 25%, and the result is 50. What was the original number?<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to figure out the original number that was increased by 25% to get 50. Hmm, let me think about how percentage increases work. When a number increases by a certain percentage, you're essentially adding that percentage of the original number to itself. 

So, if I let the original number be something like x, then a 25% increase on x would mean I'm taking 25% of x and adding it to x. That can be written as x plus 25% of x. But 25% is the same as 0.25 in decimal form, right? So 25% of x is 0.25 times x. 

Putting that together, the equation becomes x + 0.25x. I can factor out the x to make it 1x + 0.25x, which adds up to 1.25x. So, 1.25 times the original number x equals 50. 

Wait, let me write that down properly. If the original number is x, then the increased amount is 1.25x. And that equals 50. So, the equation is:

1.25x = 50

Now, to find the original number x, I need to solve for it. That means I have to get x by itself on one side of the equation. Since x is multiplied by 1.25, I should divide both sides of the equation by 1.25 to isolate x. 

So, dividing both sides by 1.25 gives me:

x = 50 / 1.25

Alright, let me do that division. 50 divided by 1.25. Hmm, I can think of 1.25 as a fraction. 1.25 is the same as 5/4, because 5 divided by 4 is 1.25. So, dividing by 5/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/5.

So, 50 multiplied by 4/5. Let me calculate that. 50 times 4 is 200, and then 200 divided by 5 is 40. So, x equals 40.

Let me check that to make sure it's right. If I take 40 and increase it by 25%, that should give me 50. 

25% of 40 is (25/100)*40 = 10. So, adding 10 to 40 gives me 50, which matches the result. So, yes, that makes sense. 

I think I did everything right here. I set up the equation correctly, solved for x by dividing, and then checked my work to ensure it's correct. So, the original number must have been 40.

To determine the original number that, when increased by 25%, results in 50, follow these steps:

1. **Let the original number be x.**

2. **Set up the equation based on the percentage increase:**
   
   25% of x added to x equals 50.
   
   This can be written as:
   
   \[
   x + 0.25x = 50
   \]

3. **Combine like terms:**
   
   \[
   1.25x = 50
   \]

4. **Solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.25:**
   
   \[
   x = \frac{50}{1.25}
   \]

5. **Perform the division:**
   
   \[
   x = 40
   \]

**Verification:**

- Calculate 25% of 40: \( 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \)
- Add to the original number: \( 40 + 10 = 50 \)

This confirms that the original number was **40**.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
