Okay, so I need to figure out how much someone pays when they buy 8 mangoes and 12 peaches from this shop. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I get it right.

First, the shop sells mangoes for $1.50 each. So, if someone wants to buy 8 mangoes, I need to multiply the price per mango by the number of mangoes they're buying. That sounds right because each mango costs $1.50, so for 8 of them, it should be 8 times $1.50.

Let me write that out to visualize it:

8 mangoes * $1.50 per mango

Hmm, so 8 times $1.50. I need to calculate that. Wait, is there a quicker way to do this? Maybe breaking it down into smaller numbers. Let me see, $1.50 is the same as $1 plus 50 cents. So if I have 8 mangoes, that's 8 times ($1 + 0.50). I can maybe distribute that multiplication.

So, 8 * 1 = 8 and 8 * 0.50 = 4. So, that would make the total cost for mangoes as $8 + $4 = $12.

Wait, does that add up? Let me check. 1 mango is $1.50, so 8 mangoes would be 8 * 1.50. Let me multiply 1.50 by 8:

1.50 * 8 = ?

Let me do it step by step. 1.50 is like 1 + 0.5, so 8 * 1 is 8, and 8 * 0.5 is 4. Adding them together gives 12. Yeah, that checks out. So, $12 for the mangoes.

Now, moving on to the peaches. The price per peach is $0.75 each. The person wants to buy 12 peaches. So, similar to the mangoes, I need to multiply the number of peaches by the price per peach.

So, that would be:

12 peaches * $0.75 per peach

Again, I can maybe break down $0.75 to make the multiplication easier. $0.75 is the same as 75 cents, which can be expressed as $0.70 + $0.05. Alternatively, I could think of it as 3/4 of a dollar.

But perhaps using the standard multiplication method is faster for me. Let me try that.

Multiplying 12 by 0.75. Alternatively, since 0.75 is 3/4, I could compute 12 multiplied by 3/4. Let me try that approach because it might be simpler.

12 * (3/4) = ?

Well, 12 divided by 4 is 3, and then 3 multiplied by 3 is 9. So, $0.75 per peach times 12 peaches is $9.00.

Alternatively, if I do 12 * 0.75, that would be:

12 * 0.75 = (12 * 75) / 100.

75 times 12 is... Let me calculate that. 75 * 10 is 750, 75 * 2 is 150, so 750 + 150 = 900. Then, 900 divided by 100 is $9.00. So, same result.

Good, so the peaches cost $9.00 in total.

Now, to find the total amount the person has to pay, I need to add the cost of mangoes and the cost of peaches together.

Total cost = Cost of mangoes + Cost of peaches
Total cost = $12.00 + $9.00

Adding those together, $12.00 plus $9.00 is $21.00.

So, the total amount the person would pay is $21.00.

Wait a second, let me just verify my multiplication one more time to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I break things down, especially with money, it's easy to slip up.

First, mangoes: 8 * $1.50. Let me do it another way: 8 * $1.50 is the same as 8 * (1 + 0.5) = 8 + 4 = $12. Correct.

For peaches: 12 * $0.75. Let me break that down as well. 10 * $0.75 is $7.50, and 2 * $0.75 is $1.50. So, $7.50 + $1.50 is $9.00. Correct.

Adding them together: $12 + $9 is indeed $21. That seems right.

I think that's all. I can't see any errors in my calculations. So, yeah, $21.00 is the total amount the person will pay for 8 mangoes and 12 peaches.

The total amount to be paid for 8 mangoes and 12 peaches is calculated as follows:

1. **Cost of Mangoes**: 8 mangoes at $1.50 each.
   - Calculation: 8 * $1.50 = $12.00

2. **Cost of Peaches**: 12 peaches at $0.75 each.
   - Calculation: 12 * $0.75 = $9.00

3. **Total Cost**: Sum of mangoes and peaches.
   - Calculation: $12.00 + $9.00 = $21.00

**Answer:** $21.00<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
