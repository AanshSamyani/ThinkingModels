Alright, so I have this fraction, \( \frac{20}{25} \), and I need to simplify it. Hmm, okay, let's see. Simplifying a fraction means making it as simple as possible without changing its value. I remember that to simplify, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator here is 20, and the denominator is 25.

First, I should find the factors of both numbers. Factors are numbers that divide into them without leaving a remainder. So for 20, the factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. For 25, the factors are 1, 5, and 25. Now, I need to find the common factors between both lists. Looking at them, I see that 1 and 5 are the common factors.

Between these common factors, I need the greatest one. That's 5. So 5 is the GCD of 20 and 25. That means I can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5 to simplify the fraction.

Let me do that. If I divide 20 by 5, that gives me 4. And if I divide 25 by 5, that gives me 5. So after dividing both by 5, the fraction becomes \( \frac{4}{5} \).

Wait, let me check if I can simplify it further. The numerator is 4, and the denominator is 5. Are there any common factors between them other than 1? The factors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4, and the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. The only common factor is 1, which means I can't simplify it any further. So \( \frac{4}{5} \) is the simplest form of \( \frac{20}{25} \).

I think that's it. I can't simplify it any more, so \( \frac{4}{5} \) is the answer.

To simplify the fraction \( \frac{20}{25} \):

1. **Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.
   - Factors of 25: 1, 5, 25.
   - Common factors: 1, 5.
   - GCD is 5.

2. **Divide both numerator and denominator by the GCD:**
   - \( \frac{20 \div 5}{25 \div 5} = \frac{4}{5} \).

3. **Final Simplified Fraction:**
   \[
   \frac{4}{5}
