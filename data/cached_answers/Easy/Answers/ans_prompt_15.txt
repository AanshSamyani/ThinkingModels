<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>What is \( \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{6} \)?<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
To subtract the fractions \( \frac{2}{3} \) and \( \frac{1}{6} \), I first need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator between 3 and 6 is 6. 

I then convert \( \frac{2}{3} \) to sixths by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 2, which gives \( \frac{4}{6} \). The \( \frac{1}{6} \) fraction remains the same.

Next, I subtract the two fractions: \( \frac{4}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} \). 

Finally, I simplify \( \frac{3}{6} \) to its lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3, resulting in \( \frac{1}{2} \).

To find the difference between \( \frac{2}{3} \) and \( \frac{1}{6} \), follow these steps:

1. **Find a common denominator:**
   
   The denominators are 3 and 6. The least common denominator (LCD) is 6.

2. **Convert \( \frac{2}{3} \) to sixths:**
   
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 2}{3 \times 2} = \frac{4}{6}
   \]

3. **Subtract the fractions:**
   
   \[
   \frac{4}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6}
   \]

4. **Simplify the fraction:**
   
   \[
   \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}
