Okay, so the user asked, "What is 25% of 120?" Hmm, I remember from math class that percentages are like parts per hundred, right? So 25% would mean 25 out of 100, or 0.25 in decimal form. 

Alright, now the question is asking for 25% of 120. That means I need to find what 25% of 120 equals. I think the best way to approach this is by converting the percentage to a decimal and then multiplying it by the number. 

Let me break it down step by step. First, take 25% and convert it to a decimal. To do that, I divide 25 by 100, which gives me 0.25. Then, I take that 0.25 and multiply it by 120. So, 0.25 times 120. 

Wait, how do I multiply a decimal by a whole number? I think it's straightforward. You can ignore the decimal point initially and just multiply the numbers. So, 25 times 120. Let me calculate that. 

25 times 100 is 2500, and 25 times 20 is 500. So, adding those together, 2500 plus 500 equals 3000. But since we divided by 100 earlier, we need to divide 3000 by 100. That gives us 30. 

So, putting it all together, 25% of 120 is 30. 

But wait, I should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me think of another way to verify. Maybe using fractions instead of decimals. 25% is the same as 1/4. So, 1/4 of 120. 

To find 1/4 of 120, I can divide 120 by 4. 120 divided by 4 is 30. Yep, that's the same result as before. 

Alright, that seems consistent. I think I've got it right. 25% of 120 is definitely 30. 

Just to be thorough, I can use a visual method. Imagine a pie divided into 100 equal slices, and 25 of them are shaded to represent 25%. If I have a circle representing 120, and I shade 25% of it, how many slices would that be? 

Alternatively, if I have 120 units and I want to split them into 100 equal parts, each part would be 1.2 units. Then, taking 25 parts would be 25 times 1.2, which is 30. That matches what I found earlier. 

I think I'm confident that 30 is the correct answer. No, wait, let me think if there's another way someone might approach this problem. Maybe by converting 25% into a fraction over 100 and then multiplying. 

So, 25% is equivalent to 25/100, which simplifies to 1/4. Then, 1/4 of 120 is 30. Yep, same result. 

Alternatively, using cross-multiplication. If 100% corresponds to 120, then 25% would correspond to x. So, (25/100) = (x/120). Solving for x, we cross-multiply to get 25 * 120 = 100x. That gives 3000 = 100x, so x = 30. Again, the same answer. 

Okay, I think I've checked this problem from every angle I can think of, and every method I try leads me back to 30. I don't think I made any calculation errors, especially since I've verified it in multiple ways. 

So, to summarize, 25% of 120 is 30. I've used decimals, fractions, visual representations, and cross-multiplication methods to arrive at the same conclusion, which gives me confidence in the answer. 

I guess the key takeaway here is that converting percentages to decimals is a straightforward process, and once you have that, multiplying by the number gives the desired percentage of the original number. It's important to remember that sometimes, especially with percentages, breaking down the problem into smaller parts or using different methods can help ensure accuracy. 

I don't think there's anything tricky here that I might be missing. It's a straightforward percentage calculation. Maybe in the future, if someone comes across a slightly more complicated percentage question, they could use similar strategies—like breaking down the problem into smaller chunks or using different methods to cross-verify. But for this one, I'm good. 

I think it's also a good idea to understand why this works. So, when you take a percentage of a number, you're essentially finding a fraction of that number. For example, 25% is a quarter, so you're finding a quarter of 120, which is 30. Understanding this helps in building a stronger foundation for more complex percentage problems later on. 

In conclusion, using a combination of decimal conversion, fraction understanding, and verification methods solidifies the answer. I feel confident that 30 is the correct and accurate result for 25% of 120.

To determine what 25% of 120 is, follow these steps:

1. **Convert the percentage to a decimal**: 
   - 25% is equivalent to 25/100, which simplifies to 0.25.

2. **Multiply the decimal by the number**:
   - Multiply 0.25 by 120.
     - 0.25 × 120 = 30.

3. **Verification**:
   - You can verify by recognizing that 25% is equivalent to 1/4.
   - Divide 120 by 4: 120 ÷ 4 = 30.

Both methods confirm that 25% of 120 is **30**.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
