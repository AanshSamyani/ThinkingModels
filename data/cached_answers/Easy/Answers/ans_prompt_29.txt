<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>What is \( 4^3 \)?<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
I need to calculate \( 4^3 \). Since 4 is the base and 3 is the exponent, it means I have to multiply 4 by itself three times.

First, I'll compute the first multiplication: \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \).

Next, I'll multiply the result by 4 again: \( 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, \( 4^3 \) equals 64.

To calculate \( 4^3 \), which means \( 4 \) raised to the power of \( 3 \), follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Expression:**
   \[
   4^3 = 4 \times 4 \times 4
   \]

2. **Perform the Multiplications Step by Step:**
   - First multiplication:
     \[
     4 \times 4 = 16
     \]
   - Second multiplication:
     \[
     16 \times 4 = 64
     \]

3. **Final Result:**
   \[
   4^3 = \boxed{64}
   \]<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
