<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Find the perimeter of a rectangle with length 7 and width 3.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
To determine the perimeter of a rectangle, I know that the formula involves adding up all the sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides—one length and one width—the formula simplifies to twice the length plus twice the width.

Given the length is 7 and the width is 3, I substitute these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 × length + 2 × width = 2 × 7 + 2 × 3.

Calculating each part separately:

2 × 7 = 14
2 × 3 = 6

Adding these together gives the total perimeter:

14 + 6 = 20.

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 20.

To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you use the formula:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
\]

Given the length is \(7\) and the width is \(3\), substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (7 + 3) = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

\[
\boxed{20}
