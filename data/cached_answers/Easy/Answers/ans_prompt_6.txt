<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Find the perimeter of a square with side length 5.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
First, I recognize that to find the perimeter of a square, I need to add up all four sides since all sides are equal in a square.

The problem states that each side of the square is 5 units long. Therefore, I can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the length of one side by 4.

Multiplying 5 by 4 gives me 20.

Finally, I conclude that the perimeter of the square is 20 units.

To find the perimeter of a square, follow these easy steps:

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   
   The perimeter (\( P \)) of a square is calculated by adding up all four sides. Since all sides of a square are equal in length (\( s \)), the formula is:
   \[
   P = 4s
   \]
   
2. **Plug in the Given Value:**
   
   In this problem, the side length (\( s \)) of the square is 5 units.
   \[
   P = 4 \times 5
   \]
   
3. **Calculate the Perimeter:**
   
   Multiply 4 by 5.
   \[
   P = 20
   \]
   
4. **Conclusion:**
   
   Therefore, the perimeter of the square with side length 5 units is:
   \[
   \boxed{20\ \text{units}}
