First, I identify the numbers involved in the division: the dividend is 25, and the divisor is 5.

Next, I assess the relationship between the dividend and the divisor to determine the type of division. Since 5 divides evenly into 25 without leaving a remainder, this is a straightforward division problem.

Finally, I perform the division to find the quotient, which is 5.
