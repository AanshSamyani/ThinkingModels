Okay, so I need to find the area of a rectangle. The problem gives me the length as 6 units and the width as 4 units. Hmm, I remember something about area from my math class. Let me think. 

Area is the space inside a shape, right? For rectangles, since they have two pairs of equal sides, the area should be calculated by multiplying the length by the width. I think the formula is Area = length × width. Yeah, that sounds right. 

So, given that the length is 6 and the width is 4, I just need to plug those numbers into the formula. That would mean Area = 6 × 4. Let me compute that. 6 multiplied by 4 is 24. 

Wait, am I sure about that? Maybe I should visualize the rectangle. If the length is 6 units, that means if I were to draw the rectangle on a grid, the longer side would be 6 squares long. The width is 4 units, so the shorter side would be 4 squares wide. Multiplying these together, each little square contributes a unit to the area, so 6 times 4 is indeed 24 units squared. 

I don't think I made a mistake here. Multiplication is straightforward, and 6 times 4 is definitely 24. So, yeah, I'm confident that the area of the rectangle is 24 square units. 

Just to double-check, let me remember that area in rectangles is commutative, meaning it doesn't matter which side you take first when multiplying. So, whether I do 6 times 4 or 4 times 6, the result is still 24. No doubt about it, that seems correct. 

Okay, so putting it all together, Area = length × width, which gives 6 × 4 = 24. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 24 square units. I think that answers the problem perfectly.

**Final Answer**
The area of the rectangle is \boxed{24}.

To find the area of a rectangle, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the length is 6 units and the width is 4 units, we substitute these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = 6 \times 4 \]

Calculating the product:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
