<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Simplify \( \frac{16}{32} \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
First, I will look at the fraction \( \frac{16}{32} \) and see if both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by a common factor.

I notice that both 16 and 32 are even numbers, so they are divisible by 2. Dividing both by 2 simplifies the fraction to \( \frac{8}{16} \).

Now, I see that 8 and 16 are also divisible by 8. Dividing both by 8 further simplifies the fraction to \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Therefore, the simplified form of \( \frac{16}{32} \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

To simplify the fraction \( \frac{16}{32} \), follow these steps:

1. **Identify Common Factors:**
   - Notice that both the numerator (16) and the denominator (32) are divisible by 2, 4, and 8.
   - To find the greatest common divisor (GCD), list the factors of each number:
     - Factors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
     - Factors of 32: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
     - Common factors: 1, 2, 4, 8
     - Greatest common factor: 8

2. **Divide Both Numerator and Denominator by the GCD:**
   - Numerator: \( \frac{16}{8} = 2 \)
   - Denominator: \( \frac{32}{8} = 4 \)
   - This simplifies the fraction to \( \frac{2}{4} \).

3. **Repeat the Simplification (if possible):**
   - The new fraction \( \frac{2}{4} \) can be simplified further by dividing both by 2.
   - Numerator: \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)
   - Denominator: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \)
   - This results in \( \frac{1}{2} \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{2}}
