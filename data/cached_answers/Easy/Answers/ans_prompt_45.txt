To solve the problem \( \frac{5}{8} + \frac{1}{8} \), follow these simple steps:

1. **Add the numerators:** Since both fractions have the same denominator (8), you can add the numerators directly.
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6
   \]
2. **Keep the denominator the same:** The denominator remains 8.
3. **Combine the results:** This gives you \( \frac{6}{8} \).

4. **Simplify if possible:** The fraction \( \frac{6}{8} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.
   \[
   \frac{6 \div 2}{8 \div 2} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

So, the final answer is \( \frac{3}{4} \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
