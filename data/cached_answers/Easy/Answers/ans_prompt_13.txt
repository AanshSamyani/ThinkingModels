<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>What is \( 7 \times 8 \)?<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
First, I need to calculate the product of 7 and 8. 

Multiplication is a repeated addition of one number by the value of the other number. So, 7 multiplied by 8 is the same as adding 7 to itself 8 times.

I will start by adding 7 to itself four times to get a partial product, which is 28.

After that, I will add 7 twice more to the partial product. 

Adding 7 two more times brings the total to 42.

Therefore, the product of 7 and 8 is 42.
