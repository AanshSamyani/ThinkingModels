<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>What is \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \)?<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Okay, so I need to figure out what \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \) is. Hmm, I remember from school that when you add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The denominator is the number on the bottom, right? So here, we have 2 and 4 as the denominators. Let me see if I can make those the same.

I think the first step is to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 2 and 4. The LCD is the smallest number that both 2 and 4 can divide into without leaving a remainder. Well, 2 times 2 is 4, so 4 is a multiple of 2. That means 4 is the LCD because it can be divided evenly by both 2 and 4.

Now that I've got the denominators to match, I can rewrite each fraction so they have 4 as the denominator. Starting with \( \frac{1}{2} \), I need to convert this to a fraction over 4. To do that, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2 because 2 is the number I need to multiply the denominator by to get 4. Let's write that out:

\( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 2}{2 \times 2} = \frac{2}{4} \)

Okay, so \( \frac{1}{2} \) is equivalent to \( \frac{2}{4} \). That makes sense because if I divide 2 by 4, it's the same as dividing 1 by 2. Cool.

Now, moving on to the second fraction, which is already \( \frac{1}{4} \). Since it's already over 4, I don't need to change it. 

So now I have both fractions with the same denominator: \( \frac{2}{4} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \). The next step is to add them together because the denominators are the same now.

Adding the numerators: \( 2 + 1 = 3 \). So, the numerator becomes 3, and the denominator stays 4. That gives me \( \frac{3}{4} \).

Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \), converting \( \frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{2}{4} \) sounds right because 1 times 2 is 2 and 2 times 2 is 4. Adding 2 and 1 gives 3, so \( \frac{3}{4} \) seems correct. 

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using decimals to confirm? Let me try that. I know that \( \frac{1}{2} \) is 0.5 in decimal form, and \( \frac{1}{4} \) is 0.25. Adding 0.5 and 0.25 should give me the same result as \( \frac{3}{4} \).

Adding them together: \( 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75 \). 

Now, \( \frac{3}{4} \) as a decimal is also 0.75 because 3 divided by 4 equals 0.75. That matches the result from converting to decimals, so it must be correct.

Alternatively, I could use visual models or fraction bars to see this. If I have a whole divided into 4 equal parts, \( \frac{2}{4} \) is 2 of those parts, and \( \frac{1}{4} \) is 1 of the same parts. Combining them, I have 3 out of 4 parts, which again is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

I think I've covered the different methods to confirm that \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \). My initial thought was correct, and both decimal and visual methods support this result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations or logic.

Just to recap, the steps I took were:
1. Identify the denominators of the fractions being added.
2. Find the least common denominator.
3. Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD.
4. Add the numerators together.
5. Form a new fraction with the sum of the numerators and the LCD as the denominator.
6. Simplify the new fraction if possible.

Following these steps led me to the correct answer, \( \frac{3}{4} \). Additionally, using alternative methods like decimals and visual models confirmed the same result, ensuring I didn't make any errors in my initial calculation.

The sum of \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \) is calculated by first finding a common denominator, which is 4. Converting \( \frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{2}{4} \), we add \( \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \). 

Thus, \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}} \).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
