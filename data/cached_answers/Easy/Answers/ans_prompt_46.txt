<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Find the perimeter of a rectangle with length 10 and width 5.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
First, I need to understand the problem. The question is asking for the perimeter of a rectangle with a given length of 10 units and a width of 5 units.

I remember that the perimeter of a shape is the total distance around its edges. For a rectangle, this would be the sum of all its sides.

Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides—length and width—I can calculate the perimeter using the formula: perimeter = 2 times (length + width).

Substituting the given values into the formula, that would be perimeter = 2 * (10 + 5).

Adding the length and the width together gives 15. Multiplying this sum by 2 results in 30 units.

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 30 units.

To find the perimeter of a rectangle, use the formula:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
\]

Given:
- **Length** = 10 units
- **Width** = 5 units

Plug the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (10 + 5) = 2 \times 15 = 30
\]

\[
\boxed{30}
