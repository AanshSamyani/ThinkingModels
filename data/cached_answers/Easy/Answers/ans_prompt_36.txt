To find the area of a square, I use the formula side length squared.

I have a square with a side length of 9 units. So, I need to compute 9 multiplied by itself.

9 multiplied by 9 equals 81.

To find the area of a square, you can use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{side length} \times \text{side length}
\]

**Given:**
\[
\text{side length} = 9
\]

**Calculation:**
\[
\text{Area} = 9 \times 9 = 81
\]

**Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{81}
