Okay, so I need to solve the equation 4x equals 20 for x. Hmm, where do I start? Let me think. I remember that solving an equation means finding the value of the variable, which in this case is x. The equation is 4 times x equals 20.

Alright, so I have 4x = 20. I think I need to isolate x to find its value. Isolating means getting x by itself on one side of the equation. Since x is being multiplied by 4, maybe I should do the opposite operation to get it out of the way. The opposite of multiplication is division, right? So, if I divide both sides by 4, that should help.

Wait, but let me make sure. If I have 4 times x and I divide both sides by 4, that would cancel out the 4 on the left side. So, on the right side, I would have 20 divided by 4. Let me write that down.

4x = 20  
Divide both sides by 4:  
(4x)/4 = 20/4

Simplifying that, 4 divided by 4 is 1, so we have x equals 20 divided by 4. 

20 divided by 4 is 5, so x equals 5. 

Wait, let me double-check that. If x is 5, then 4 times 5 is 20, which matches the original equation. So, yes, that seems correct.

I guess another way to look at it is by thinking about the equation 4x = 20 as dividing 20 into 4 equal parts. Each part would be x. So, dividing 20 by 4 gives me 5, which is each part. Therefore, each x is 5.

This makes sense because if I have 4 groups of x and they add up to 20, then each group must be 5. So, x is definitely 5.

Is there another method to solve this? Maybe using multiplication tables. If I think about what number multiplied by 4 gives me 20, that number is 5 because 4 times 5 is 20.

Yes, that's the same answer I got earlier. It seems like the answer is consistently 5.

I wonder if there are any other approaches. Maybe using fractions. If I have 4x = 20, I can write it as x = 20 divided by 4. As I did before, 20 divided by 4 is 5. So, again, I get x equals 5.

Is 5 the simplest form? It can't be simplified further because 5 is a whole number and 4 times 5 is exactly 20. So, I think I'm confident that x equals 5 is the correct solution.

Let me summarize my steps:

1. Start with the equation: 4x = 20.
2. To isolate x, divide both sides by 4.
3. This simplifies to x = 20/4.
4. Calculate 20 divided by 4 to find x equals 5.

Each step makes sense and leads logically to the conclusion. I don't think I've missed anything here. It seems pretty straightforward, which is a good sign.

Another way to verify is by substituting x = 5 back into the original equation. If I plug 5 into 4x, I should get 20. 

4 * 5 = 20.

Yes, that's exactly what the original equation says. So, substituting x = 5 works perfectly.

I think I've considered multiple methods and each time, I end up with x equals 5. So, it's pretty solid. There's no doubt in my mind now that x is 5.

Maybe, just to check my work, I can try plugging different numbers into 4x and see which one gives me 20. Let's see:

- If x = 1, 4*1 = 4 ≠ 20.
- If x = 2, 4*2 = 8 ≠ 20.
- If x = 3, 4*3 = 12 ≠ 20.
- If x = 4, 4*4 = 16 ≠ 20.
- If x = 5, 4*5 = 20. Correct.

So, no other number between 1 and 5 works except 5. Therefore, x must be 5.

Is there a graphical method I could use? Maybe plotting the equation on a graph and finding the x-intercept. For 4x = 20, if I graph it on a coordinate plane, I can represent it as a straight line. The x-intercept would be where the line crosses the x-axis, which is at x = 5.

Plotting 4x = 20 on a graph, the line would pass through (0,20) and (5,0). So, visually, the x-intercept is at (5,0), confirming that x is 5.

Alright, I think I've explored several methods to solve this equation and each time, I arrive at x equals 5. I can't find any errors in my reasoning, and all substitutions and graphical methods align with this solution.

Therefore, I'm pretty confident that the solution to 4x equals 20 is x equals 5.

To solve the equation \(4x = 20\) for \(x\), follow these steps:

1. **Start with the equation**:
   \[
   4x = 20
   \]

2. **Isolate \(x\)** by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{20}{4}
   \]

3. **Simplify both sides**:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

Thus, the solution is:
\[
x = 5
